This time around he was a going a bit slower thanks to that whole aging thing. He told us embellished stories from his previous trips about getting into fights with rangers and helping out fellow hikers. We know they were embellished because he told us they were.

This area was teaming with hikers, all looking for a break from the endless walking.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The river was far from the main attraction though. Coming out of the ground all around the area was multiple hot springs, each one dammed up with stone walls.

Sorry for the buzzkill. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`The Silverwood Lake Rabbit`}</h2>\n    <p>{`We continued through the desert as we made our way to the Mojave dam.

To my surprise, the bunny was caught in the coil of an insidious snake. I went to grab a stick to throw at it, and as soon as the snake saw me move it bolted and the rabbit ran free.

A few weeks later Strawberry stayed behind while the rest of the group she was with went ahead. The next day she went missing, it was her first time ever hiking alone. `}</p>\n    <p>{`There is a YouTube video that Dennis and I had watched that was uploaded in Strawberry's honor back when the event happened. She was sitting there listening to a man play the guitar. We found out that the video was uploaded by Guitar himself, and that was him playing in it. It was a very chilling moment to be so close to a tragedy we had only ever read about online. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`Oodles of Poodles`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The next morning we had waffles for breakfast at the hotel. A carb surplus would do us well as we set forth on a two day stretch of all uphill.

It is poisonous, with skin rashes comparable or worse than that of poison oak. The top leaves are green, but the leaves below are all gray, wilted, and dead. This, combined with the fact that it grows outwards up to several meters in length, gives it an appearance like it's reaching for life while everything beneath it dies. It only grows in recent forest fires, so often times it will be standing amongst a forest of blackened tree carcasses. On top of all that, it has a rank smell that fills the air. There is no mistake that a Poodle Dog Bush is nearby. `}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180504_194225-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">It's coming for you...</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`The PDB was overgrown in this section of the trail.
