Canada is only 11 miles away, I'll be done with the entire hike before lunch. I hope I am able to catch up with him so we can hike the last few miles together.

The sites were not the best -  they were flat but on the ridge it would leave the tents exposed to the elements. However looking at the map it was unlikely anything better was going to come up for miles and we needed to get out of this weather.

In 20 minutes we would be done, no more hiking day after day after day. We could hear cheers in the distance of hikers a little ahead of us who were reaching the monument. These sounds of celebration helped cement the fact that this was really it.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180925_135708-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">The mountains in the distance? Those are in Canada.</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`The next signal of the end was a view of the clear cut that marks the US/Canada border. It was as clear as a line on a map, distinctly showing which side was the United States and which side was our neighbors to the north. Then about a quarter mile before reaching the monument we got a glimpse of it through the trees. It felt like seeing a unicorn, this mythical structure that we had been seeking for over 5 months.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180925_135923-500x417.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">If you look for the little notch on the top of the ridge you'll find the clear cut.</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`Minutes later we reached the monument ourselves. The big finale. The end of the amazing journey. It was crowded with about a dozen other hikers. Some of them I recognized but none of them I knew. I felt like I had walked in on someone else's party. Dennis and I had to wait our turn to take pictures. The commotion felt chaotic and made us uncomfortable. As soon as our pictures were taken Dennis continued on into Canada to setup camp. I lingered for a few more minutes to send some satellite messages to my girlfriend and my family.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180925_140807-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">Not the experience of solitude I was used to.</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`It wasn't until I left the monument and made my first steps, alone, into Canada that I felt excitement for what I had just accomplished. I felt relieved to be done with this huge trip, no more endless days of pushing my body to exhaustion. But I also felt a pensive nostalgia as I remembered all the incredible parts of the journey.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180925_140954-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">I have a new appreciation for something being \"within walking distance.\"</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`I got to the camp, Dennis was already setting up his tent. My dad would be meeting us there that evening with some celebratory bourbon and then hiking out with us to the road the next morning. The two of us hung out and reminisced for awhile until some light rain pushed us into our tents.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180925_141232-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">We were done, but with one last night in the woods.</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`Dennis said he felt the end was anti-climatic. I got what he meant. We spent 5 long months hiking over 2652 miles through deserts, mountains, and forests. The journey was dramatic and at times overwhelming. But the end was just a whisper. A period at the end of a long sentence.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I was now in Canada yet the meaninglessness of a border was even more reinforced. Nothing was different. The Earth doesn't care what people say is theirs. It all belongs to nature. I felt the same way as I feel on my birthday. When people ask \"What's it like to be one year older?\" the answer is it feels no different.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180925_141558-428x500.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <h2>{`Transitioning Back`}</h2>\n    <p>{`After a few hours of waiting around my dad finally arrived. It didn't feel like we were meeting up though, but rather like I was having a visitor. The woods had become my home, and my dad was coming over to see my new digs. At the same time his arrival helped to stabilize my realization of the end. My dad helped provide a grounding back to my life as I began my adjustment back to the real world.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180925_141906-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">Hey dad!</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`In my interactions with my dad I could see the contrast of where my journey had taken me. He was the one who first introduced hiking and backpacking to me. All of my outdoor techniques and habits had been adapted from him. But after nearly 6 months in the woods many of those had evolved and changed, and I could now see where they had all started.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180925_142254-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">On my first ever backpacking trip with my dad and two of my friends in Highschool, we brought Smoked Sprats for lunch. There was an extra can we didn't eat and it has sat in my pantry ever since. I thought this would be a fitting time to crack them open.</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`We made our way down to Route 3 in Canada and from there my dad drove Dennis and I to Seattle. It felt surreal to be done and it was hard to come to grips with what we had just accomplished. My dad kept trying to tell us how immense of a feat we had done, but it didn't really register.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180925_142813-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">Not quite the same backdrop.</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`That night in Seattle we took a ride up to the Space Needle for sunset. From the top we could see Mount Rainier and the entire length of the Washington Cascade Mountains. As I gazed out at the horizon I thought to myself \"I hiked everything I can see out there and more\" and for the first time I felt the scale of what I had completed. A guy walked by me and and passively said \"Epic isn't it?\" I simply responded \"Yeah\".`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180925_143157-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <h2>{`Beauty in the Pain`}</h2>\n    <p>{`In the wee hours of the morning Dennis woke up to catch his flight down to San Diego. He packed his things and our goodbye was a few quick whispers followed by a fist bump while my dad slept. A big adventure together with a farewell that lasted less then a minute. It really felt over now. It was hard to fall back asleep.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I spent the next day walking through Seattle with my dad. Everything felt more intense. My senses seemed heightened, I noticed the people, the cars, the wind through the trees, everything so much more. I felt more relaxed and in the moment. There was no pressure to go, go, go.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180925_143610-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">The hustle of the city is quite the difference from the quiet of the forest, yet I felt at peace in both.</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`One week later and it already feels like a distant memory. I feel integrated into normal life again, my feet are feeling better, the dirt and tan lines are fading. It's almost as if it didn't happen at all.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180925_143819-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">On my flight back I watched as we passed over many of the landmarks I had spent days hiking around.</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`I am already feeling nostalgic of the trail. Its beauty and its adventure. But I am forgetting all the pain. While I was hiking I was missing parts of life back at home but blocked out the hard parts there too. Whether embarking on a huge adventure or working a desk job, every part of life has its pains and its beauty. The Pacific Crest Trail was a once in a lifetime journey, but really every moment only happens once in a lifetime. If there was one takeaway from this trip it is to savor the present and to always try and find the beauty in the pain.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180925_144119-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">I may be done with the Pacific Crest Trail, but it will always be a part of me now no matter where I am.</Figcaption>\n\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
