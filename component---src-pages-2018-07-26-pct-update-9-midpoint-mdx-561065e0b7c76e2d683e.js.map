The hiking community that had been talked up so much on the forums online was not something I felt apart of. I felt alone and a bit insecure.

Along the way we got to see a thermal geyser that spewed steam 100 feet into the air. A small stream flowed out of the bottom of it, steaming and boiling it's way down the mountainside. At another point was a lake literally named Boiling Lake. The water bubbled and churned and the gurgling and hissing could be heard even at a distance.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180724_201651-375x500.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">This cloud is doing it wrong.</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`The wonders of the volcano wasn't the only thing coming in hot.

My body was beaten, my feet sore and numb, and I had run out of water a couple hours before. Unfortunately the promised town turned out to be quite the disappointment. There was one store, and it was closed. I filled up my water bottles from a garden hose in the back and chugged several liters until I could think straight.

While initially frustrating, we did need the rest so the down time ended up being appreciated. We attempted to hitchhike to a breakfast place a few miles down the road while we waited.

They sold some hot food and a small assortment of junk food. As I perused about, I noticed another hiker standing in line. He seemed to be stretching, but in a really odd way. It was almost as if he was leaning back to the point of falling over. A moment later my brain correctly processed what was happening, and to my realization he was in fact falling over. His head hit the edge of a shelf before his body collapsed limply on the floor.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In the next instance every bit of information from my 2 day Wilderness First Aid training came flooding into my mind all at once. I reached for my phone as I tried to pick out the parts I needed from the confusing jumble of procedures that swirled inside of my head, the difficulty only enhanced by the stress of a real first aid situation arising. `}</p>\n    <p>{`As I grabbed my pockets I remembered I had left my phone plugged in and charging in another room. I shouted for someone to call 911 as I ran to the downed hiker. In nearly 80% of the exercises I had done in the First Aid training we had to assume a possible brain or spine injury. The reason being is that a simple fall from an upright standing position is enough to cause one. I understood in that moment the importance of that emphasis. Through the jumbled thoughts I knew the first thing I needed to do was to stabilize the patients head to protect it in case of damage. All this happened in a matter of seconds.`}</p>\n    <p>{`As the hiker came to I explained to him what happened and that it was best for him to stay lying down until the paramedics came who would have the experience and tools to properly assess any injuries. I began to go down the list of the questions I was taught to ask, going in the order that I remembered them as opposed to the order they were supposed to go in. After a few minutes a cook from the store came out of the back and told me he was an EMT. He took over from there until the ambulances arrived.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180724_203600-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">A bit bigger and better equipped then the ATVs in the other shot.</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`The hiker was thankfully fine. He had had a pressure point in his shoulder that when he went to stretch it he blacked out. The fall did not cause a concussion and the paramedics left without any additional medical assistance needed. The hiker went back out onto the trail later that day. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`Feel the Burn`}</h2>\n    <p>{`That afternoon we packed back up and continued onward. Along the way we stopped to check out an old lava flow cave. We walked a quarter mile underground from one entrance to another. We could see where the lava had dripped and hardened on the ceiling. The best part, though, was that it felt like we were in an air conditioned building. If only the rest of the trail could've felt like that.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180724_203919-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">Some of these climbs would be way easier if we could just go through the mountain.</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`As we marched on, we witnessed one of the most spectacular sunsets yet. Huge dramatic clouds filtered reds and oranges onto the open landscape. At one point I came across a doe and her two babies. We made eye contact as volcanic mountains and glistening clouds towered behind them. I followed the deer family off trail for a few minutes where I watched them gallop across an open field and into the sunset.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180724_204920-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">The sky looked like it was something that existed only in expensive movie special effects.</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`We awoke the next morning to the rumble of distant thunder. A sunrise as spectacular as the sunset greeted us from behind the distant rain clouds. We were hiking over a section know as Hat Creek Rim and it had a reputation for being hot, dry and exposed. The overhead clouds blocked the morning sun, giving us a false sense of cool temperatures.

We were determined to finish this trail together.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180726_090718-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">Views like this.</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`For the second time on this trip we said goodbye. He hitched into a nearby town, looking for some needed rest and to make up for the time I would be taking off with my girlfriend. After that I was hiking alone for the first time since we split while I went home back in the desert. It was sad, but we will back hiking together in a couple of weeks, and at that point it will be the endgame.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180726_093413-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">All alone.</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`I've come to realize why it took so long for this trip to feel like a thru hike vs just an extended backpacking trip. The missing ingredient was pain, both physical and mental. A backpacking trip is an outdoor vacation. It's all fun, pushing your body and seeing some amazing sights. But a thru hike is a challenge, a life experience. Once the shine wears off, the pain and emotions start to set in. It's in that fight to push through that pain and keep going all the way to the end that makes this an adventure of a lifetime and not just an extended vacation.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180726_094128-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
