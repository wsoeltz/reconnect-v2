But the hike into Sierra City, with it's forests and phasing out of the granite, really starts to feel like the next section.

We passed by some locals drinking on their porch and they offered us a cold beer. We politely declined but got into chatting. As the conversation wandered it's way between talking about the trail and life living out in a place this remote, it eventually reached an unexpected topic-big foot. They began to tell us their stories of the times they had seen Sasquatch. At first we thought they were joking, but the more they elaborated we realized they were dead serious.
