They are breathable, water resistant, and their traction is designed for everything from mud to snow.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Performance`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The first thing I noticed when I was looking at these shoes was how big the tread is. They perform great in slippery and wet conditions. Unless it’s icy, I’ve never felt like these shoes were about to slip out underneath me. The contagrip really grips onto everything.`}</p>\n    <p>{`These shoes also sport a water and debris resistant mesh. I’ve never used gaiters with them and never felt like I’ve had to. The mesh does a good job of keeping out the dirt and dust.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The water resistance will stop minor splashes, but it isn’t going to do much if you step in a puddle or if it’s raining heavily. On the flipside if your feet get wet they will dry out very quickly as the water goes both ways.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"20171202_084814-500x281.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": \"Descending A Snowy Ladder\"\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">The grip worked great on this, although my feet were a little cold.</Figcaption>\n    <h2>{`Durability`}</h2>\n    <p>{`I’ve had these shoes for a year now and they have held up fine.

A tip for improving comfort while breaking them in is to wear them a little bit looser.

I had never used speed laces before, and was a little skeptical at first, but with them you can get a tight fit and be on the trail in an instant.

The speed laces will be off in seconds and your feet free of confinement.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If you plan to use these shoes in the shoulder seasons, the lightweight breathability of this shoe also means it lacks any real insulation.
