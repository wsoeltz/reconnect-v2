I created this blog to help inspire and provide information for those looking to reconnect with the world and not with their wi-fi. In everyday life I am a designer and developer, and this blog is my way of using my skills to push that vision forward.<figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kyle-soeltz-on-pawtuckaway-500x500.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle Soeltz\" /></figure><h2>Where Does Your Time Really Go?</h2>Our time is so much more limited than we realize. We say we have our whole lives to do things, but how much time do we really have? When everything that has to get done is taken out of that, how much is left? And worst of all, how much of that free time is then wasted doing things that aren’t even fulfilling?<figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/welcome-be-here-now-500x240.jpg\" alt=\"Be Here Now\" /></figure><h2>You Only Have 33 Years To Live</h2>Let’s start with the average US life span of 79 years. Now deduct all the necessary parts of life-<ul> \t<li>Sleeping - 24 years</li> \t<li>Eating - 4 years</li> \t<li>Cleaning - 2 years</li> \t<li>Grade school - 2 years</li> \t<li>Driving - 4 years</li> \t<li>Working -10 year</li></ul>And you’re left with only 33 years. To be clear, this isn’t saying these things are ‘bad.’ In fact, many people find great enjoyment out of their work or from eating, and without sleep you couldn’t get anything else done! Of course if you’re going to spend 4 years of your life eating, don’t waste that time eating bad tasting food.<h2>Around 60% of Your Remaining Life Will Be Spent In Front of a Screen</h2>Studies have found that the average person will spend over <a href=\"http://mediakix.com/2016/12/how-much-time-is-spent-on-social-media-lifetime/#gs.6ZfbNx8\">5 years on social media</a>, and nearly <a href=\"http://mediakix.com/2016/12/how-much-time-is-spent-on-social-media-lifetime/#gs.6ZfbNx8\">8 years watching TV</a>. And that number is on the rise. Some studies say that we spend up to 24 years of our lives plugged in. That would be 72% of your free time spent on a screen!It would be one thing if all this media consumption was truly fulfilling, but social media plays on our <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/biological-psychological-reasons-for-social-media_us_58c279a7e4b0c3276fb78388\">addiction centers</a> and even uses <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vv5jkb/the-secret-ways-social-media-is-built-for-addiction\">similar practices as casino games</a> to keep us coming back for more. Why? Because advertisers want your data and attention.<h2>Experience the World On Your Feet, Not On Your Phone</h2>We all only have so much time on this Earth, don’t spend it living through a screen. Hike a mountain. Go out into the town with those close to you. Reconnect with nature, with people, with the world.<figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/welcome-on-your-feet-500x500.jpg\" alt=\"Boardwalk along mountain trail\" /></figure>&nbsp;"

I have used them for trail running, day hiking, and backpacking from mid-spring to mid-fall. They are breathable, water resistant, and their traction is designed for everything from mud to snow.</p><h2>Performance</h2><p>The first thing I noticed when I was looking at these shoes was how big the tread is. They perform great in slippery and wet conditions. Unless it’s icy, I’ve never felt like these shoes were about to slip out underneath me. The contagrip really grips onto everything.</p><p>These shoes also sport a water and debris resistant mesh. I’ve never used gaiters with them and never felt like I’ve had to. The mesh does a good job of keeping out the dirt and dust.</p><p>The water resistance will stop minor splashes, but it isn’t going to do much if you step in a puddle or if it’s raining heavily. On the flipside if your feet get wet they will dry out very quickly as the water goes both ways.</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/20171202_084814-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"Descending A Snowy Ladder\" /><figcaption>The grip worked great on this, although my feet were a little cold.</figcaption></figure><h2>Durability</h2><p>I’ve had these shoes for a year now and they have held up fine. They have been my primary trail shoe, handling everything from trail runs to Presidential Traverses. So far I have not noticed any wear and tear beyond the tread shrinking down a bit as expected.</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/prezi-traverse-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"Prezi Traverse\" /><figcaption>These shoes worked great on a prezi traverse.</figcaption></figure><p>I would advise against using these shoes on pavement, concrete, or any surface other than a trail. While the huge tread is great for traction on the trail, it will be eaten up quickly if used on these harder surfaces. I use a separate pair of shoes as my running shoes around town so I can preserve my Speed Crosses.</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/road-run-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"Road Run\" /><figcaption>But don't use them on pavement!</figcaption></figure><h2>Comfort</h2><p>Be warned, these shoes fit very narrowly. When I was first breaking them in I almost returned them they were so uncomfortable. I routinely had to stop hiking to take them off because the sides of my feet were in pain.</p><p>I’m glad I gave them the benefit of the doubt though, because once broken in they feel like feathers on my feet. A tip for improving comfort while breaking them in is to wear them a little bit looser. This helped my feet a lot, and now I can fully tighten them with no problems.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Salomon-Speedcross-Runner-Everglade-Sulphur/dp/B01HD6279K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1521139613&sr=1-1-spons&nodeID=7141123011&psd=1&keywords=salomon+speedcross+4&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=19939ce9838b8844b2d09a023426f00a\" target=\"_blank\">Salomon Speed Cross 4</a> comes with speed lacing, which is so much nicer than standard shoe laces. I had never used speed laces before, and was a little skeptical at first, but with them you can get a tight fit and be on the trail in an instant. Just got to camp and you’re ready to put on your camp shoes? The speed laces will be off in seconds and your feet free of confinement.</p><p>If you plan to use these shoes in the shoulder seasons, the lightweight breathability of this shoe also means it lacks any real insulation. I hiked with these on a 30 degree day through a light snowfall for about 7.5 miles and my feet were decently cold by the end. This is not what these shoes are designed to do, and I would recommend something a little thicker for such conditions.</p><figure>\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Salomon-Speedcross-Runner-Everglade-Sulphur/dp/B01HD6279K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1521139613&sr=1-1-spons&nodeID=7141123011&psd=1&keywords=salomon+speedcross+4&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=19939ce9838b8844b2d09a023426f00a\" target=\"_blank\">\t\t<img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/solomon-speed-cross-product-500x286.jpg\" alt=\"Salomon Speed Cross 4\" />\t</a></figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Pros</strong></th><th><strong>Cons</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul> \t<li>Great traction</li> \t<li>Decent job of keeping out debris</li> \t<li>Dries easily when wet</li> \t<li>Speed laces are great</li> \t<li>Really lightweight</li> \t<li>Breathable</li></ul></td><td><ul> \t<li>Will burn up quickly on pavement</li> \t<li>Very narrow fit until broken in</li> \t<li>Not very water resistant</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>"

Height) in one go. If you are using any maps, such as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mountains-National-Forest-Appalachian-Mountain/dp/1628420774/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521140268&sr=8-2&keywords=white+mountain+maps&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=894c1428fc36ec198a3a8c39a94a09a5\" target=\"_blank\">AMC’s</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mountain-National-Forest-Geographic-Illustrated/dp/159775224X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1521140424&sr=1-1&keywords=white+mountain+map+national+geographic&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=8c59314184e80bc2e82cded66e5b27d5\" target=\"_blank\">National Geographic’s</a>, you won’t find the loop on there. These maps make it look as though you have to do a long road walk or a lot of backtracking if you wanted to grab all three in one day. But thanks to an old logging road that’s not on the maps, you can grab all three of these New Hampshire 4000 footers in a nice, full loop.</p><h2>Start From the Nineteen Mile Brook Trailhead</h2><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/19-mile-brook-compressed-500x500.jpg\" alt=\"19 Mile Brook\" /><figcaption>The 19 Mile Brook that the trail is named after.</figcaption></figure><p>Park your car at the Nineteen Mile Brook Trailhead and begin your hike. You will stay on Nineteen Mile Brook for about 3.7 miles, all the way to the Carter Lakes. The trail is easy, as the grade is very low. You will gradually gain around 1970 feet of elevation. Once you reach the first Carter Lake, you begin to make your way around it before hitting a junction. Here you will turn left onto the Carter-Moriah Trail.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/carter-notch-lake-compressed-500x328.jpg\" alt=\"Carter Notch Lake\" /><figcaption>Carter Notch Lake.</figcaption></figure><h2>Turn Left Onto The Carter-Moriah Trail</h2><p>The Nineteen Mile Brook Trail will hopefully have warmed you up, as the grade is about to go from gradual to incredibly steep. This is the hardest climb of the loop as you will nearly double the elevation you’ve done so far over the next mile. You will go up around 1500 feet from the junction to the summit of Carter Dome, the first 4000 footer of the day.</p><p>The summit has some nice views as well as the remains of an old firetower. After taking in the views, you will continue along the Carter-Moriah Trail for about .4 miles downhill until reaching another junction*. Here you can choose to continue on the Carter-Moriah Trail up over Mt. Height or bypass it by taking the trail around it. Both trails will lead to the same point.</p><h2>Option 1 - Mt. Height and the Carter-Moriah Trail</h2><p>I highly recommend taking the route up Mt. Height, which will add 0.2 miles and 136 feet of elevation gain to your hike. Its 360 degree open summit may be the best views you get along this loop. To reach mount Height, turn right at the fork and continue along the Carter-Moriah Trail.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_20171113_105922_114-500x452.jpg\" alt=\"Views off Mt. Height\" /><figcaption>Views looking off of Mt. Height.</figcaption></figure><p>Once you’ve taken in the views, you will descend the trail until you meet back up with the bypass. Turn right and you will continue onto the Carter-Moriah Trail. Shortly afterwards you will reach the junction for the Carter Dome Trail and the Carter-Moriah Trail. Keep going along the Carter-Moriah Trail.</p><h2>Option 2 - Bypass Mt. Height</h2><p>If you choose not to do Mt. Height, then you save .2 miles and about 136 feet of elevation, as mentioned above. This brings your day’s stats to 12.1 miles and 4464 feet of elevation.</p><p>Once you meet back up with the Mt. Height cutoff, continue straight on the Carter-Moriah trail until you reach the junction for the Carter Dome Trail and the Carter-Moriah Trail. Keep going along the Carter-Moriah Trail.</p><h2>Middle Carter</h2><p>From the junction you have about 1.8 miles and another 950 feet of elevation until reaching Middle Carter. There are some nice ridgeline views as you approach the summit, but the summit itself is in the trees.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/middle-carter-ridge-compressed-500x500.jpg\" alt=\"Middle Carter Ridge\" /><figcaption>The open ridge leading up to Middle Carter.</figcaption></figure><p>As you continue along the trail you will reach the junction for the North Carter Trail, but for now you will want to continue straight along the Carter-Moriah Trail.</p><h2>North Carter and the North Carter Trail</h2><p>You’re now just a short quarter of a mile and about 100 feet of elevation until the last 4000 footer of the day.</p><p>Once you hit the peak, you will head back down to the North Carter Trail junction and turn onto it. Follow the North Carter Trail for 1.2 miles until you reach the junction for the Imp Trail. </p><h2>Left Onto the Imp Trail</h2><p>At the Imp Trail junction, you will want to turn left. Follow the Imp Trail for about 2 miles and you will come onto a very obvious logging road. It cuts across the trail in both directions and is wide enough that a car could fit on it. It should be very hard to miss.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/imp-trail-evening-light-compressed-500x328.jpg\" alt=\"Imp Trail Evening Light\" /><figcaption>Some beautiful evening light coming through the trees along the Imp Trail.</figcaption></figure><h2>Left Onto the Logging Road</h2><p>The logging road is very straightforward. Follow it for a little ways and it will take you out to the back of Camp Dodge. Walk through Camp Dodge back to the road and turn left on the road. You will have a very brief road walk back to the Nineteen Mile Brook trailhead.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/imp-trail-logging-road-closeup-compressed-500x500.jpg\" alt=\"Imp Trail Logging Road Map\" /><figcaption>A close up of the logging road cutoff. <a href=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/imp-trail-logging-road-closeup-compressed.jpg\">View Larger Map.</a></figcaption></figure>"

Before I had always wondered what I needed them for- I had never had a problem getting up and down mountains without them, how would using them make any difference? But hiking in the snow is a totally different game, and after embracing them they’ve now made it into my all-season gear essentials. Between the uphill advantages and the downhill knee-saving, I would highly recommend adding poles to your kit if you haven’t already. And my trekking pole of choice right now is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Trail-Ergo-Cork-Walking-70-140cm/dp/B00GZPYWFS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521140917&sr=8-3&keywords=black+diamond+trail+ergo+cork+trekking+poles&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=fee10b2da2d0d1c5907b1019115699fb\" target=\"_blank\">Black Diamond Trail Ergo Cork Trekking Poles</a>.</p><h2>Performance</h2><p>In my experience, Black Diamond typically makes very good products and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Trail-Ergo-Cork-Walking-70-140cm/dp/B00GZPYWFS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521140917&sr=8-3&keywords=black+diamond+trail+ergo+cork+trekking+poles&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=fee10b2da2d0d1c5907b1019115699fb\" target=\"_blank\">Trail Ergo Cork poles</a> live up to that. I have used these poles on everything from ascending steep snow filled ravines to bushwhacking thick forests.</p><p>The tips of the poles have kept me stable on ice and have saved me more than a handful of times from slipping and falling. I weigh ~170lbs and have used them carrying around a 30-40 pound pack and I have never seen any issues in terms load capacity.</p><p>For adjusting height, they have dual FlintLocks that allow for quick and easy resizing. This allows for people of most heights to use these poles, as well as change the size depending on the slope and direction you are hiking. Shorter for uphill, longer for downhill.</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/20151205_084950-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Bushwhacking with the Black Diamond Ergo Cork Poles\" /><figcaption>A winter bushwhack using the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Trail-Ergo-Cork-Walking-70-140cm/dp/B00GZPYWFS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521140917&sr=8-3&keywords=black+diamond+trail+ergo+cork+trekking+poles&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=fee10b2da2d0d1c5907b1019115699fb\" target=\"_blank\">Ergo Cork Poles</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>One of the main issues with these poles is that when they come new the screws aren’t tight enough to keep the poles from sliding back into themselves. The continual pressure from hiking will slowly push the poles back down to a shorter length.</p><p>This can get annoying when you repeatedly have to stop and readjust the height. In the winter it can be even more frustrating if moisture gets inside and freezes, thus preventing you from being able to readjust the height until it has defrosted.</p><p>Thankfully it is a really simple fix for this issue. All you have to do is tighten the screws yourself and the poles should work fine.</p><h2>Durability</h2><p>I have had these poles for 3 years now and I have yet to have any malfunctions. I regularly take them on hikes throughout the White Mountains, and while they have plenty of scratches, functionally they are still at 100%.</p><p>I wouldn’t consider these poles “heavy”, but there are certainly lighter ones on the market if that is what you are looking for. I have heard horror stories of people getting ultralight trekking poles and having them snap days into their trip.What these poles may lack in lightness they do make up for in hardiness.</p><p>I am planning on taking these on a <a href=\"http://reconnect.life/category/pacific-crest-trail/\">PCT thru hike Spring 2018</a>, and will update this review with how well they hold up when I get back.</p><h2>Comfort</h2><p>These poles have two key design features centered around comfort: a 15° corrective angle and cork handles.</p><p>The corrective angle is supposed to keep your wrists in a neutral position to improve comfort and decrease the chance of repetitive motion injuries. While this may be true, I haven’t noticed the benefits myself. I do always make sure to use the poles in the correct hands, but occasionally I’ll have them backwards by accident and it doesn’t feel noticeably different.</p><p>Now the cork handle is something that I absolutely stand by. Regardless of what pole you get, I highly recommend getting one with cork handles.</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/black-diamond-ergo-cork-poles-closeup-compressed.jpg\" alt=\"Black Diamond Ergo Cork Poles, Cork Grip\" /><figcaption>The cork grip.</figcaption></figure><p>One of the best aspects of the cork is that it doesn’t conduct temperatures very well. It always feels pretty neutral, meaning in the summer it won't be too hot to touch and in the winter it won't be freezing. </p><p>Additionally the cork absorbs moisture, meaning your grip will always be strong no matter how sweaty your hands get.</p><figure><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Trail-Ergo-Cork-Walking-70-140cm/dp/B00GZPYWFS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521140917&sr=8-3&keywords=black+diamond+trail+ergo+cork+trekking+poles&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=fee10b2da2d0d1c5907b1019115699fb\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/trail-ergo-cork-poles-product-189x500.jpg\" alt=\"Black Diamond Ergo Cork Poles\" /></a></figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Pros</strong></th><th><strong>Cons</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\"><ul> \t<li>Great stability and performance</li> \t<li>Easy to adjust height</li> \t<li>Highly durable, doesn’t break easy</li> \t<li>Cork handles are the best kind of handles</li></ul></td><td><ul> \t<li>FlintLock doesn’t hold the poles height in place without manually tightening the screws</li> \t<li>On the more expensive side</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>"

No matter how experienced you are, something could happen outside of your control that leaves you in need of immediate medical help. It doesn’t need to be for yourself either, as it could be someone in your group or someone you come across on the trail who needs help.<figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/whiteout-compressed-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Whiteout on Mt Washington\" /><figcaption>You never know when you could get hit with a below zero whiteout while hiking on an exposed ridgeline.</figcaption></figure>While your emergency transponder should only ever be used as a last resort, it is still no substitute for being prepared and having the knowledge for an emergency situation. A PLB does not guarantee a rescue, as things like harsh weather could impair the beacons signal or prevent a search and rescue team from being able to reach you.When it comes to discussing the different options out there, there are two types of devices to look at and three different networks that they run on.<h2>Personal Locator Beacons and COSPAS/SARSAT</h2>PLBs run on the COSPAS/SARSAT network, a non-profit network that is basically military run. It is the most comprehensive satellite network of the three and it spans the entire globe. The network began back in 1979 as a joint program between the US, Canada, France, and the USSR (replaced by Russia in 1992).The network runs on satellites as well as ground stations placed throughout the planet. An average of 5 people are rescued everyday through the use of COSPAS/SARSAT. These devices serve one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to call for help. They do not cost a subscription and the batteries typically last for years in standby.For more information on the network, you can access the <a href=\"https://cospas-sarsat.int/\">official COSPAS/SARSAT website</a>.<figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/where-plb-on-pack-compressed-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Wear your Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) in an easy to reach location.\" /><figcaption>It is a good idea to keep your PLB or Satellite Messenger in an easy to reach location in case you are too impaired to dig through your pack.</figcaption></figure><h2>Satellite Messengers and Private Networks</h2>Satellite Messengers run on private, for-profit networks, either Globalstar or Iridium. While both claim to be global or near global, neither is as comprehensive as COSPAS/SARSAT. These networks also require a yearly subscription to use. If you don’t pay the subscription, no one is going to come when you press the button.Additionally, the frequency at which the <a href=\"https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/topics/camping-and-hiking/best-personal-locator-beacon/buying-advice\">satellite messengers emit their distress signals</a> is not as powerful as those of the PLBs. You are more likely to make contact with a satellite on the COSPAS/SARSAT network then you are on Globalstar or Iridium. Also most Satellite Messengers run on disposable or rechargeable batteries, and you will regularly have to make sure your device is properly charged.There are still many reasons why you might choose a Satellite Messenger over (or in addition to) a PLB. Since they are on private networks and you are paying a subscription fee, they generally have a whole host of extra features. At a minimum, these additional features include being able to send preset messages and tracking your position for your friends and family at home to see. The higher end devices allow for two texting communication via satellite, so you can communicate with others even outside of cell range. Some models even include full on GPS capabilities, complete with topographic maps and waypoints.<figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/blue-sky-compressed-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"An open, blue sky\" /><figcaption>If you can, make sure you have direct access with the sky when using a PLB or Satellite Messenger.

Like the ACR it is waterproof, however it is not buoyant unless used with an included floatation case. Being primarily a hiker, I did not feel the flotation was a necessary feature. The Ocean Signal is also a little bit lighter, weighing in around 4 ounces which helps keep my pack weight down.<h2>Suggested Satellite Messengers</h2><h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-010-01735-10-Inreach-Explorer/dp/B01MY03CZP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521141571&sr=8-3&keywords=garmin+inreach+explorer&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=a2afc9755a344443c898e9b8271fc6f2\" target=\"_blank\">Garmin InReach Explorer+</a></h3><figure><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-010-01735-10-Inreach-Explorer/dp/B01MY03CZP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521141571&sr=8-3&keywords=garmin+inreach+explorer&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=a2afc9755a344443c898e9b8271fc6f2\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/garmin-inreach-explorer-plus-compressed.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin InReach Explorer+\" /></a></figure>This is the do-it-all Satellite Messenger.

Further, doing it as an out and back from the North will take no less than 17.5 miles (compared to 10 miles from the south) and require you to do Mount Whiteface twice. But what if there was a way to do it as a loop from the north?</p><figure><a href=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/passaconway-whiteface-map.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/passaconway-whiteface-map-377x500.jpg\" alt=\"Map of Passaconaway-Whiteface\" /></a><figcaption>Map of the Passaconaway/Whiteface route.

This is my favorite way to do these peaks, as it has some fantastic views going down and adds some excitement with the navigation. Be warned, this trail should only be attempted if you have experience bushwhacking. There are several sections where the trail teeters out and you will need to rely on your own ability to continue navigating through. I also recommend taking the trail down instead of up, as it is easier to follow going down.</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/trail-up-passaconaway-411x500.jpg\" alt=\"Trail Up Whiteface\" /><figcaption>The trail heading up to Mount Whiteface.</figcaption></figure><h2>\tStart on the Downes Brook Trail off the Kancamagus Highway</h2><p>\tMake sure to pay attention to the signs at the beginning of the hike, as there are a couple turns that could lead you up Mt. Potash, Mt. Hedgehog, or back to the parking lot. Once you’ve gone past these forks, you will have a straight walk along the Downes Brook Trail for 4.9 miles. For the first 4 miles it is a very easy, gradual grade. The last mile you will see some gain in steepness before hitting the junction of the Kate Sleeper Trail. You will want to turn left here and will be given a half mile of flat hiking before another steep section as you near the Mt. Whiteface summit.</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/berries-on-whiteface-summit-375x500.jpg\" alt=\"Berries on the summit of Whiteface\" /><figcaption>Someone left berries on the summit cairn of Mount Whiteface.</figcaption></figure><h2>\tMount Whiteface and the Rollins Trail</h2><p>\tAt the end of the Kate Sleeper Trail, you will reach the junction for the Rollins Trail. Turn right and you will be a short .1 mile climb from the summit of Mt. Whiteface. After reaching the summit, you will backtrack down the Rollins Trail and follow it in the other direction for 2.4 miles. This section will offer some nice ridgeline hiking with gradual ups and downs.</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/whiteface-ridgeline-500x488.jpg\" alt=\"Whiteface Ridgeline\" /><figcaption>Views off the Mount Whiteface ridgeline.</figcaption></figure><h2>\tDicey’s Mill Trail up Mount Passaconaway</h2><p>\tYou will eventually reach the junction for Dicey’s Mill Trail. Here you will take a left and follow signs for the Mt. Passaconaway summit. It will be about .9 miles of switchbacks until you reach the top.</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/views-off-passaconway-500x291.jpg\" alt=\"Views off Passaconaway Spur\" /><figcaption>Views off of the Mount Passaconaway spur.</figcaption></figure><h2>\tFinding the start of the abandoned trail</h2><p>\tFrom the summit of Mt. Passaconaway you will want to take the .3 mile spur trail to the view. The start of the abandoned trail is on the left of the spur trail heading towards the view, about 10-30 feet before you reach the actual view point. It is not extremely clear at first, but with some looking you should be able to find it. It will be slightly more open than the surrounding forest, and there may be some debris (logs, branches, etc) piled around as a way of keeping the entrance secluded. Once on the trail it will be become immediately obvious within 10-20 feet of walking as the trail is very clear once you pass the hidden entrance.</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/passaconway-whiteface-map-abandoned-trail-closeup-500x500.jpg\" alt=\"Map of Abandoned Trail off Passaconaway\" /><figcaption>Closeup of the abandoned trail.</figcaption></figure><h2>\tFollowing the trail and it’s dicier sections</h2><p>\tThe trail is extremely easy to follow at the beginning. There may be some thicker sections, but there is a very clear footpath. This ease will fade, as the footpath will gradually become less clear and some searching and good backcountry navigational judgement will be required. Along the trail there are occasional cairns that other hikers have setup, so keep an eye out for them but also don’t rely on them completely.</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/views-off-passaconaway-abandoned-trail-379x500.jpg\" alt=\"Views of Passaconaway Abandoned Trail\" /><figcaption>The abandoned trail has some of the best views of the whole loop.</figcaption></figure><p>\tYou will eventually be led to a river, and the trail will cross over it several times. It is around the time of the river that the trail will become increasingly more difficult to follow, so it is good to know that this river eventually flows directly into the Downes Brook and links directly to the Downes Brook Trail. So if finding the trail becomes too difficult, just make sure to continue following the river.</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wildflowers-passaconaway-500x282.jpg\" alt=\"Wildflowers on Passaconaway\" /><figcaption>Some wildflowers along the river on the Passaconaway abandoned trail.</figcaption></figure><h2>\tLinking back up to the Downes Brook Trail</h2><p>\tUltimately when the abandoned trail meets back up with the Downes Brook Trail, you will be on the East side of the river. When you link back up to the trail, you will turn right and follow the Downes Brook Trail for about 2 miles back to the parking lot.</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/downes-brook-trail-442x500.jpg\" alt=\"The Downes Brook Trail\" /><figcaption>Heading back out along the Downes Brook Trail</figcaption></figure>"

There are a lot of small things you can do as well that will chip that base weight down, and a lot of them can be done on the cheap. What may seem like only savings of less than an ounce on it’s own will roll up to much more when combined with other weight saving techniques.</p><h2>1) Cut the labels off your clothes and gear</h2><p>Do you really want to carry “Made in China, Size L/G, Machine Wash Cold” with you for your entire journey? It sounds like such a small thing (and it is) but it’s an easy 10 grams to be rid of.</p><p><strong>Estimated Weight Savings:</strong> 10 grams</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/labels-compressed.jpg\" alt=\"Labels\" /><figcaption>You can find labels on everything from your down puffy to your sleeping pad’s stuff sack</figcaption></figure><h2>2) Get lighter tent stakes, repackage tent bags</h2><p>There are many stakes you can get that are lighter than the ones that came with your tent. For example these <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ti-Shepherds-Hook-Stake-Orange/dp/B001OPKGAO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1518198438&sr=8-9&keywords=lightweight+tent+stakes&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=ffa2263cf5d71bc899ec1255c78286d6\" target=\"_blank\">titanium tent stakes</a>. Going from the ones that came with my tent to lighter stakes saved 62 grams <i>and</i> I am bringing an extra one for backup.</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tentstakes-compressed.jpg\" alt=\"Tent stakes comparison\" /><figcaption>The original tent stakes for the Nemo Hornet 2P on left, the lighter titanium stakes on the right.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally you can take your tent poles out of their dedicated stuff sack, as well as swap out the stuff sack for the tent stakes with a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ziploc-Storage-Quart-Bags-Count/dp/B019ZTZTVQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1521141783&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=ziploc+bags&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=dfc0842068dc8ff564cc1cd5ab5327e4\" target=\"_blank\">Ziploc bag</a>. All this will give you another 10 grams in savings.</p><p><strong>Estimated Weight Savings:</strong> 72 grams</p><h2>3) Bring smaller toiletries (toothbrush, floss)</h2><p>Going with a travel toothbrush (or cut the handle off of a regular toothbrush) will save you about 11 grams. A smaller floss box is another 6 grams. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Bronners-Organic-Castile-Peppermint/dp/B000Z96LTA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521141856&sr=8-4&keywords=dr+bronners+travel&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=6c987b07408fcc87c5fae51bb5491e23\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Bronner’s soap</a> can be used as toothpaste, as well as body/hand wash, and even to wash your pot and utensils if you have too, so no need for a tube of toothpaste. Make sure  you get the smallest Dr. Bronner’s available for even more savings. You can also get smaller nail clippers and save yourself another 9 grams.</p><p><strong>Estimated Weight Savings:</strong> 133 grams</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/toiletries-compressed.jpg\" alt=\"Toiletries comparison\" /><figcaption>A side to side comparison of the different toiletries.</figcaption></figure><h2>4) Repackage your first aid kit</h2><p>A lot of first aid kits come in big, cool looking packages. Those packages are also fairly heavy. Taking all the contents out and putting them in a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ziploc-Storage-Quart-Bags-Count/dp/B019ZTZTVQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1521141783&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=ziploc+bags&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=dfc0842068dc8ff564cc1cd5ab5327e4\" target=\"_blank\">Ziploc bag</a> cut the package weight from 32 grams to 7 grams.</p><p><strong>Estimated Weight Savings:</strong> 25 grams</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/medkit-compressed.jpg\" alt=\"Medkit and Ziploc Bag\" /><figcaption>The original medkit bag looks way cooler then the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ziploc-Storage-Quart-Bags-Count/dp/B019ZTZTVQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1521141783&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=ziploc+bags&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=dfc0842068dc8ff564cc1cd5ab5327e4\" target=\"_blank\">Ziploc bag</a>, but it's also way heavier.</figcaption></figure><h2>5) Roll your toilet paper, duct tape, athletic tape</h2><p>Don’t go full roll on the toilet paper (but also don’t skimp yourself.) Rolling down to half a roll will take you from 174 grams to 33. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Duck-394468-All-Purpose-Inches-Silver/dp/B0006HX2MK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521142058&sr=8-3&keywords=Duct+tape&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=2cd10029c7a7847257f127abd8ce5688\" target=\"_blank\">Duct tape</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mueller-Athletic-Tape-15yds-White/dp/B001N06OK6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1521142100&sr=1-5&keywords=athletic+tape&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=641eafa170dfbff7eea57a544b6e4252\" target=\"_blank\">athletic tape</a> in your med kit can also be rolled onto themselves. They will retain their stickiness but be much more compactable and lighter weight. The duct tape will bring you from around 130 grams to 21 grams and the athletic tape will bring you from around 39 grams to 19 grams.</p><p><strong>Estimated Weight Savings:</strong> 270 grams</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/toilet-paper-duct-tape-athletic-tape-compressed.jpg\" alt=\"Rolled Toilet Paper, Duct Tape, and Athletic Tape\" /><figcaption>A before and after for rolling toilet paper, duct tape, and medical tape.</figcaption></figure><h2>6) Use tyvek or polycryo instead of an official tent footprint</h2><p>Tent footprints can help extend the life of your tent and improve waterproofing. You can purchase an official one from the tent manufacture, or make a much lighter one yourself. The two most popular materials to make one from are <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Campcovers-Tyvek-Ground-Cloth-Grommet/dp/B00AOFRE4G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521142188&sr=8-5&keywords=tyvek+ground+cloth&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=391d597f19ba8152a9a6d4d0cf8530d9\" target=\"_blank\">tyvek ground cloth</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Duck-5-Window-Insulator-210-Inch-281504/dp/B000NHY1P0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1521142269&sr=1-4&keywords=window+insulation&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=f73312986c7d4bd98402f12b7941cc70\" target=\"_blank\">polycryo</a> (more commonly known as window insulation). Tyvek is a little heavier than polycryo but also more durable. There are many sites that talk about <a href=\"https://sectionhiker.com/ultralight-backpacking-tent-footprint-substitutions/\">creating your own tent footprint</a>. I am currently using a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Duck-5-Window-Insulator-210-Inch-281504/dp/B000NHY1P0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1521142269&sr=1-4&keywords=window+insulation&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=f73312986c7d4bd98402f12b7941cc70\" target=\"_blank\">polycryo</a> footprint, which is about 32 grams compared to 195 grams on the manufacturer’s footprint.</p><p><strong>Estimated Weight Savings:</strong> 163 grams</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/polycryo-compressed.jpg\" alt=\"Polycryo On Scale\" /><figcaption>Polycryo rolls up nice and small.</figcaption></figure><h2>7) If you can, remove the brain of your pack</h2><p>The ‘brain’ of a pack is the very top section that often has extra pockets. These pockets can help with organization, but if you can get everything into the other areas of the pack, removing the brain can save a bit of weight. On my <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Osprey-Packs-Backpack-Basalt-Medium/dp/B00E0LGFUE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1521142349&sr=8-1&keywords=Osprey+Exos+58&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=c969cddef1f748ed634d9e4ced4f6585\" target=\"_blank\">Osprey Exos 58</a>, removing the brain saves 113 grams.</p><p><strong>Estimated Weight Savings:</strong> 113 grams</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/osprey-exos-with-brain-removed-compressed.jpg\" alt=\"Osprey Exos with Brain Removed\" /><figcaption>The pack on the left with detached brain on the right.</figcaption></figure><h2>8) Get the Deuce of Spades for your poop shovel</h2><p>If you’re carrying any trowel other then the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tentlab-Spades-Backcountry-Trowel-ounces/dp/B00UTK5HJ0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1521142431&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=deuce+of+spades&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=9489b596ed7fd3b0ef5d511eb94b4628\" target=\"_blank\">Deuce of Spades</a>, you’re missing out. Most other trowels weigh around 3.5 ounces, whereas the Deuce weighs a measly .6 ounces, or 17 grams.</p><p><strong>Estimated Weight Savings:</strong> 82 grams</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deuce-of-spades-compressed.jpg\" alt=\"Deuce of Spades\" /><figcaption>The Deuce of Spades.</figcaption></figure><h2>9) Leave your Sawyer squeeze backflush and pouch at home. Backflush with a smart water top</h2><p>If you’re carrying a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sawyer-Products-SP131-PointOne-Squeeze/dp/B00B1OSU4W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1521142465&sr=1-2&keywords=sawyer+squeeze&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=6e1ffaee6cb57d6e6aacb1e257148388\" target=\"_blank\">Sawyer Squeeze</a> for your water filter, you can make it even lighter by using a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjITyLFelWc\">smart water bottle to backflush it</a> instead of the syringe it comes with. Additionally you can screw the filter right onto the Smart Water bottle and drink out of it, leaving the bag it comes with at home.</p><p><strong>Estimated Weight Savings:</strong> 59 grams</p><figure><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sawyer-pouch-backflush-compressed.jpg\" alt=\"Sawyer Squeeze Pouch and Backflush\" /><figcaption>The included 1 liter pouch and backflush for the Sawyer Squeeze.</figcaption></figure><h2>2lbs of total weight savings</h2><p>Doing all of these seemingly small things will net you 927 grams or a whole 2 pounds of savings. That’s like carrying a second tent or three extra <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Personal-Cooking-System-Carbon/dp/B002N18PHO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1521142553&sr=1-3&keywords=jetboil&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=c88c45e087f8a5ef4143d721ee8566ce\" target=\"_blank\">JetBoils</a>!

Baker Mittens Waterproof Shell</figcaption></figure><h2>Performance</h2><p>If you need your hands to be warm, then these mittens will do the trick. I picked them up after I spent several hours with freezing hands on a winter hike. I needed a solution and boy did these guys come through.</p><p>Using these, plus a lightweight glove liner, I have had warm and toasty hands down to zero degrees. I haven’t had any opportunities to go colder with them yet, but I feel confident I could go another 5-10 degrees with this setup before needing something warmer.</p><p>When Outdoor Research describes <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Research-Baker-Modular-Mitts/dp/B0059BISMC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1521142758&sr=1-1&keywords=mt+baker+mittens&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=5e8b48cba78abe71a4c0d54eda57b3fc\" target=\"_blank\">Mt. Baker Modular Mittens</a> as being waterproof, they mean it. I have been in freezing rain and climbing through deep snow drifts, and the shell has kept my hands nice and dry in both occasions. Of course like most waterproof gear this works both ways- if you put wet hands in the shell, it’s not going to be drying out anytime soon.</p><figure>\t<img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hiker-in-snow-storm-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Hiker in snow storm\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-303\" />\t<figcaption>It was cold out, but my hands were toasty</figcaption></figure><h2>A Layer System For Your Hands</h2><p>The two part design allows you to have the same layer control that you have over your body but with your hands. I typically bring a pair of glove liners as well, allowing me to alternate between varying degrees of warmth, dexterity, and waterproof-ness. </p><p>As I said above, I feel comfortable going down to 5-10 below with this setup, but with the layer system I can also go up to the 30s. If it’s cold but dry I might go just the fleece layer. If it’s wet and a little chilly, then just the shell. Cold but not thatttt cold? Shell plus my liners. </p><figure>\t<img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mt-baker-mits-fleece-closed-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Mount Baker Mitts Fleece Liner, Closed\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-305\" />\t<figcaption>The Fleece Liner</figcaption></figure><h2>Good Dexterity ‘Options’</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Research-Baker-Modular-Mitts/dp/B0059BISMC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1521142758&sr=1-1&keywords=mt+baker+mittens&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=5e8b48cba78abe71a4c0d54eda57b3fc\" target=\"_blank\">Mt. Baker Modular Mittens</a> inner fleece has convertible capabilities allowing you to expose your fingers and thumb. There are magnets on the fleece that keeps the fleece folded open without it continuously bouncing back while you are trying to tinkle with gear/food/bear attacks.</p><p>If you combine this with the wrist straps of the shell, you can quickly toss off the outer layer, fold back the fleece, and you now have full dexterity without having had to remove the mittens and put them in the snow or back in your pack.</p><p>If you are a bushwhacker, there is one unexpected downside to the magnets on the fleece. While compass navigating, the magnet can cause the compass to point in the wrong direction. So if you intend on doing a lot of compass navigation, you may want to look elsewhere.</p><figure>\t<img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mt-baker-mits-fleece-open-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Mount Baker Mitts Fleece Liner, Open\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-306\" />\t<figcaption>The Fleece Liner Opened Up</figcaption></figure><h2>Durability</h2><p>I have had the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Research-Baker-Modular-Mitts/dp/B0059BISMC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1521142758&sr=1-1&keywords=mt+baker+mittens&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=5e8b48cba78abe71a4c0d54eda57b3fc\" target=\"_blank\">Mt. Baker Modular Mittens</a> for 4 seasons now and they show no signs of breaking down or failing. The material seems strong and durable. I have taken them on thick bushwhacks before and they have held up perfectly while pushing through trees and scraping on branches.</p><h2>Cost</h2><p>For the warmth and waterproof capabilities that these mittens provide, they are very reasonably priced. Some of the features found in more expensive mittens include increased insulation, waterproofing of the inner fleece (for when it’s worn separately), and even ones with battery powered heating. But for warmth to cost ratio, I would certainly recommend the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Research-Baker-Modular-Mitts/dp/B0059BISMC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1521142758&sr=1-1&keywords=mt+baker+mittens&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=5e8b48cba78abe71a4c0d54eda57b3fc\" target=\"_blank\">Outdoor Research Mt.

The outer ring of the snowshoe is rigid with crampon-like teeth that provides traction beyond that provided by the standard crampon below the foot. The flotation itself is comprised of a lightweight rubber webbing material that stretches across the shoe.<p><figure>\t<img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/msr-lightning-ascent-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"MSR Lightning Ascent Snowshoes\" title=\"MSR Lightning Ascent Snowshoes\">\t<figcaption><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSR-5608-Lightning-Snowshoe-22-Inch/dp/B00LFJNHRI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521143105&sr=8-3&keywords=msr+lightning+ascent+snowshoes&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=efef4ddf18a5b35db45e67d785bf8f3b\" target=\"_blank\">MSR Lightning Ascent snowshoes</a></figcaption></figure><h2>Performance</h2><p>I have used these throughout New England and the level of flotation has been great. I have almost never felt a need for anything bigger. At times the size can almost be overkill with the typical depth of the snow in the White Mountains, but their lightweight and the great traction makes them worth it even in those situations.<p><p>There have been a handful of trail breaking trips through knee-to-waist deep snow where the flotation proved effective, but I could have benefited from a slightly larger snowshoe. If I was doing that level of snow depth more regularly then I would probably pick up the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSR-Lightning-Snowshoe-Tail-Black/dp/B00464GMB2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1521143254&sr=1-2-fkmr1&keywords=msr+lightning+ascent+snowshoes+extensions&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=046b08a1edb02d2b01a8d4885e05e3b0\" target=\"_blank\">flotation tail extenders</a> that MSR sells. <p><figure>\t<img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/snow-filled-trail-sign-500x347.jpg\" alt=\"Snow filled trail sign\" title=\"Snow filled trail sign\">\t<figcaption>You'll be happy for the flotation when you come across a trail sign by your feet that is normally at eye level.</figcaption></figure><p>The traction is very effective. I never find myself slipping in the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSR-5608-Lightning-Snowshoe-22-Inch/dp/B00LFJNHRI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521143105&sr=8-3&keywords=msr+lightning+ascent+snowshoes&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=efef4ddf18a5b35db45e67d785bf8f3b\" target=\"_blank\">Lightning Ascents</a>. This is almost to a fault, as I love being able to slide down the mountain when the snow depth and terrain allows for it, but the traction makes that very difficult.<p><h2>Durability</h2><p>I have had the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSR-5608-Lightning-Snowshoe-22-Inch/dp/B00LFJNHRI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521143105&sr=8-3&keywords=msr+lightning+ascent+snowshoes&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=efef4ddf18a5b35db45e67d785bf8f3b\" target=\"_blank\">Lightning Ascents</a> for 4 seasons now and they don’t have any damage beyond the expected wear and tear. The crampons and ridges along the edge have worn out a fair amount. There is still enough there to provide traction, but the points have become curved and flat on a lot of them. MSR also sells a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSR-Snowshoe-Field-Maintenance-Kit/dp/B0010Y4VL4/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_3?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1521143254&sr=1-3-fkmr1&keywords=msr+lightning+ascent+snowshoes+extensions\" target=\"_blank\">field repair kit</a> to bring with you.<p><figure>\t<img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/msr-lightning-ascent-wear-and-tear-462x500.jpg\" alt=\"Wear and tear on MSR Lightning Ascent Snowshoes\" title=\"Wear and tear on MSR Lightning Ascent Snowshoes\">\t<figcaption>Some wear and tear on the traction.</figcaption></figure><p>The rubber webbing has remained fully intact, although some of the edges are a little frayed or split. Occasional sticks pop through the openings between webbing and the ridges and  it will rough up the webbing.<p><p>Overall the snowshoes support me as well as they did when I got them despite the general wear and tear on them.<p><h2>Comfort</h2><p>Once these snowshoes are on your winter boots you won’t even notice them. They are very comfortable once you get going, but putting them on is a different story. The rubber straps can freeze up and be very hard to work with when it is down to single digits or below. I often have to take my hands out of my gloves to finagle with the strap system, which is not ideal when it’s 4 degrees out.<p><p>The straps are comfortable as long as you are wearing a thick enough boot. I once wore the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSR-5608-Lightning-Snowshoe-22-Inch/dp/B00LFJNHRI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521143105&sr=8-3&keywords=msr+lightning+ascent+snowshoes&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=efef4ddf18a5b35db45e67d785bf8f3b\" target=\"_blank\">Lightning Ascents</a> with my <a href=\"http://reconnect.life/2018/01/18/solomon-speed-cross-4/\">trail runners</a>, and I could feel the straps digging into my feet the entire hike. But under normal circumstances with a winter hiking boot the straps are fine.<p><p>If you plan to take these <a href=\"http://reconnect.life/2018/02/14/passaconaway-whiteface-abandoned-trail-loop-from-the-north/\">bushwhacking</a>, the openings between the webbing and the edges can sometimes get branches stuck in them. This can be annoying, especially if the branch is stuck to a log and yanks you back while you’re hiking. This can also happen on a typical trail, although it is far less common.<p><p>One great comfort benefit of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSR-5608-Lightning-Snowshoe-22-Inch/dp/B00LFJNHRI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521143105&sr=8-3&keywords=msr+lightning+ascent+snowshoes&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=efef4ddf18a5b35db45e67d785bf8f3b\" target=\"_blank\">Lightning Ascents</a> is the heel lifts. This is just a simple bar on the back of each snowshoe that can be popped up to provide a ‘step’ for your heel. It makes steep, snowy uphills feel like walking up stairs. It is everything that say it is in regards to reducing fatigue and increasing performance.<p><h2>Cost</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSR-5608-Lightning-Snowshoe-22-Inch/dp/B00LFJNHRI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521143105&sr=8-3&keywords=msr+lightning+ascent+snowshoes&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=efef4ddf18a5b35db45e67d785bf8f3b\" target=\"_blank\">MSR Lightning Ascents</a> are some of the most expensive snowshoes on the market. They typically sell in the $200-$300 range, whereas other models can come in under $200 and even under $150. However they do give quite a lot for their price. The weight to flotation and traction ratio is one of the best (if not the best) you can find. They are durable, and the traction is so extensive that even as they wear down they won't let you slip.<p><figure>\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSR-5608-Lightning-Snowshoe-22-Inch/dp/B00LFJNHRI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521143105&sr=8-3&keywords=msr+lightning+ascent+snowshoes&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=efef4ddf18a5b35db45e67d785bf8f3b\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/msr-lightning-ascent-product-500x355.jpg\" alt=\"MSR Lightning Ascent Snowshoes\" title=\"MSR Lightning Ascent Snowshoes\"></a>\t<figcaption><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSR-5608-Lightning-Snowshoe-22-Inch/dp/B00LFJNHRI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521143105&sr=8-3&keywords=msr+lightning+ascent+snowshoes&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=efef4ddf18a5b35db45e67d785bf8f3b\" target=\"_blank\">MSR Lightning Ascent snowshoes</a></figcaption></figure><h2>Summary</h2><table><tbody><tr><td><h2>Pros</h2></td><td><h2>Cons</h2></td></tr><tr><td><ul> \t<li>High flotation</li> \t<li>Great traction</li> \t<li>Durable</li> \t<li>Heel lifts are awesome</li> \t<li>Lightweight for amount of flotation</li></ul></td><td><ul> \t<li>Expensive</li> \t<li>Straps are difficult to operate when cold</li> \t<li>Straps uncomfortable in anything other than a thick boot</li> \t<li>Sticks will occasionally get caught in holes</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>"

I’ve spent hours repackaging dehydrated food into smaller ziplock bags and looking through maps to plan where I can actually get the food sent to me.</p><p>At this point, most of my gear has been purchased and is ready to go. Which is great, because I am so tired of researching gear! A common question I get is, “How heavy is your pack going to be?” Without including food and water, the answer is about 17 pounds. On average, I’ll be carrying an additional 5 to 20 pounds of food and water, depending on where I am on the trail.</p><figure>\t<img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/packing-freeze-dried-meat-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Packing Freeze Dried Meat\"/>\t<figcaption>Bags and bags of dehydrated meats. Mmmmm.</figcaption></figure><p>I am excited and nervous for this trip to begin. I look forward to the experience of waking up to the sunrise and falling asleep under the stars. To be hearing, seeing, and feeling the natural world around me day in and day out. I am excited for the freedom that comes with the simplicity of hiking, where a simple shelter from the rain and some hot food become things of enjoyment and the need for constant digital stimulation ceases. </p><p>And I am nervous for the days of pain that will push me to my mental limits. For the homesickness that will inevitably hit, and the desire to just wake up in a warm bed or to see my girlfriend’s smiling face as I shiver myself to sleep after three days of hiking in the rain.</p><p>I will be posting updates about my trip here on my blog, so check back often or join my mailing list at the bottom of the page to hear about new posts. I’ll also be posting photos of all the cool things I’m sure to see on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reconnectlife/\">Instagram</a>, so follow me on there too!</p><figure>\t<img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/new-england-hiking.jpg\" alt=\"New England Hiking\" />\t<figcaption>See you in 6 months New England!</figcaption></figure>"

Funny how things fall into place, even if the timing is not in accord with our expectations. Thanks to yours and Dennis' interest in the trail, I have been learning so much about hiking the PCT.  Your preparations and meticulous planning for life as a thru-hiker in the various eco-systems of the PCT, have been an incredible eye opening experience, alone, for me. Now that you will set off to live and breathe the experience, I will turn to \"reconnect.life\" to hear and see what you make of your days on the trail. You are strong and brave and loved by so many. Multitudes of wishes for blessings and magic on your journey!!! I Love you!!!"

I will likely send the water bags home after the desert. </p><figure>\t<img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/water-filter-capacity-500x386.jpg\" alt=\"Sawyer Squeeze and additional water capacity\"/>\t<figcaption>The Sawyer Squeeze with the different water bags that I will be bringing.</figcaption></figure><ul> \t<li>Filter - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sawyer-Products-SP131-PointOne-Squeeze/dp/B005EHPVQW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1522178434&sr=1-2&keywords=Sawyer+Squeeze&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=50ec3bdd8c26f5c0be219ecda4aaa703\">Sawyer Squeeze</a></li> \t<li>Backup - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Potable-Aqua-Purification-Treatment-Tablets/dp/B001949TKS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1522178456&sr=1-4&keywords=Iodine+tablets&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=32891f3dc3040053682834cbd5880320\">Iodine tablets</a></li> \t<li>Water Bottles - 1.5L Smartwater Bottles x2</li> \t<li>Additional Water Capacity - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Evernew-Water-Carry-System-2000ml/dp/B000AQYY5Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B000AQYY5Q&pd_rd_r=BACWJ9J3WEVN3EWNW84M&pd_rd_w=vRo5G&pd_rd_wg=pWziX&psc=1&refRID=BACWJ9J3WEVN3EWNW84M&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=50ed41fb9762748ed8c3d136a169f9f5\">Evernew 2L bag</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Platypus-SoftBottles-with-Closure-Cap/dp/B0076ZSL5I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B0076ZSL5I&pd_rd_r=00S5WESZW4JYY4ZJDTJ4&pd_rd_w=9lNkf&pd_rd_wg=PbhAO&psc=1&refRID=00S5WESZW4JYY4ZJDTJ4&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=617a109c054fc235aa0d30f37af630ec\">Platypus 1L bag</a>, Sawyer Squeeze 1L water bags x2</li></ul><h2>Sun Protection</h2><p>Another problem in the desert is the constant sun exposure.

I dont want to publically publish her number here,  but how can I get you and Dennis her number.  Do you or Dennis receive texts? Let me know.  My number is 619-977-8419.  Since my number is everywhere I dont care who knows it lol.  Maybe send me a text and I'll respond back with their info.  They said they would really like to give you guys an extra contact to have.

                     "__cdata": "<p>It is the fifth night of my hike and I have given up on sleeping for the night. The point at which I gave up is after my tent collapsed on me twice due to the intensity of the winds. And it's only 10:30, it's probably going to happen again. There's a saying that thru hikers go by - \"embrace the suck.\" Meaning when the shit hits the fan, you still have to find the positive. In this case since I know I won't be sleeping, I now have all this time to reflect and write about the beginning of my journey. </p><figure>    <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180408_092040-500x378.jpg\">    <figcaption>The Southern Terminus of the Pacific Crest Trail.</figcaption></figure><h2>2659 Miles To Go</h2><p>It's day one. Dennis and I are taking our first steps on the trail and we can't stop taking pictures. I know there's going to be moment after picture-worthy moment for the next six months, yet I still feel like I need to capture everything. It feels surreal, to finally be making a reality out of something that has been spreadsheets of research and planning for the last half a year plus. </p><figure>    <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180408_092137-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"The beginning of the PCT\">    <figcaption>An early section of the trail.</figcaption></figure><p>The trail is welcoming and easier then expected. Dennis, who hiked the Appalachian Trail 20 years ago, exclaims \"I think this is love at first sight.\" The gradual incline of the PCT and the lack of boulders and roots to step over provides him, and me, with excitement for the days ahead. </p><p>Yet despite the excitement, it doesn't feel like I'm starting a 6 month thru hike. It feels just like any other weekend hiking trip. We take turns posing for pictures at the 1 mile sign, and I know that we have an insane 2,659 left to go, but the gravity of that number is far from setting in.</p><figure>    <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180408_092311-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis at Mile 1\">    <figcaption>Dennis excited at the completion of our first PCT mile.</figcaption></figure><h2>Breakfast Burritos and Trail Magic</h2><p>It's day 3 on the trail, and I wake up wet in my tent. It didn't rain, but we camped out by Lake Morena and the morning condensation is not stopped by a rain cover. Not to worry though, we walk into the nearby town to get breakfast burritos while our stuff dries under the morning sun. </p><figure>    <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180408_092643-500x337.jpg\" alt=\"Lake Morena\">    <figcaption>The morning fog rolls away.</figcaption></figure><p>One of the main things you think about while hiking the desert section of the PCT is your water plans. Water is heavy, probably the heaviest thing you're carrying in your pack. If you carry too much it'll slow you down, and if you don't carry enough, well we all know what could happen then. Thankfully there are a handful of apps and websites for hikers to use that give the latest updates on water sources along the trail. Much of a day is centered around where you're gonna stop for water.</p><p>As we arrived to our next water source at a nearby campground, we were surprised by some trail magic. A guy named Steve had come down to the campground with food and drinks for PCT hikers. There were granola bars, peanut butter and jelly, Gatorade, beer, and best of all- fresh tangerines right off the vine from a local farm. Steve had been a trail angel for several years now, he started when a buddy of his was hiking the trail and enjoyed bringing him food and hanging with the hikers that he made it a tradition. It was a welcome surprise, so thank you Steve!</p><figure>    <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180408_094506-500x375.jpg\">    <figcaption>It's termed the desert, but it's actually a cismontane chaparral due to all of the green vegetation that is able to grow.</figcaption></figure><h2>Banjo In the Breeze</h2><p>It's day 4 and I'm approaching Mount Laguna, a small town in the desert mountains of Southern California. I stop in the Burnt Rancheria campground while I wait for Dennis. I sit alone at a picnic table under the shade of some trees. Nearby a car camper plays the banjo. I listen to the tunes and the sound of the breeze as the smell of pine wafts through the air. I take a sip of some fresh water as I relax in this oasis in the middle of the desert. </p><figure>    <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180408_095102-500x375.jpg\">    <figcaption>The pine forests of the Mount Laguna region.</figcaption></figure><h2>Wind Storm</h2><p>It's day 5 and the pine forests of the Mount Laguna area quickly dissipate in favor of the chaparral vegetation that is signature of the region. But these small green shrubs are not to be taken for granted, for views of the true desert begin to make their way into our sights. </p><figure>    <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180408_095337-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"The real desert looms in the distance\">    <figcaption>The true desert looms in the distance.</figcaption></figure><p>As we continue onward, we are hit with what feels like hurricane winds. Walking in a straight line becomes difficult and we welcome any part of the trail that wraps around the backside of the ridgeline and shelters us from the winds.</p><p>Hungry and tired, we reach our intended camp site only to find the winds far to strong to setup a tent in. Dennis is frustrated because he found a great spot half a mile earlier but I was too far away to consult about it. So we keep going.</p><figure>    <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180408_095743-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Late afternoon lighting on the mountains\">    <figcaption>Late afternoon lighting hits the distant mountains.</figcaption></figure><p>Just a little ways further we come across a small dip in the ridgeline where there is some wind protection. We quickly setup camp and huddle into our tents to hide from the elements. My fingers are so dirty my phone's fingerprint scanner won't recognize it. As I lie in my shelter hoping it doesn't collapse again, I finally start to feel like I'm on a thru hike.</p><figure>    <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180408_095549-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Tent at sunset\">    <figcaption>This was before it collapsed.</figcaption></figure><h2>Bonus: The Kitchen Shed</h2><p>I was originally going to end this post at day 5, but then day 6 happened. The barren desert in the distance became a reality as  the hills and greenery turned to desolate flat lands. Under the heat of the sun we put in our first 20 mile day.</p><figure>    <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180408_100152-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"The Anza-Borrego desert\">    <figcaption>The wide open Anza-Borrego Dessert.</figcaption></figure><p>As we neared our goal for the day, we decided to hitch a ride into the old mining town of Julian. The idea of a burger, shower, and a bed made the final push to the road all that much easier. A friendly Polish couple who now reside in rural California picked us up and chatted with us the whole way in.</p><figure>    <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180408_100251-500x375.jpg\">    <figcaption>Sometimes I wondered if I was actually a robot in Westworld.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course things don't always go as planned. As we started looking around for a place to stay we found out that everything was booked. My girlfriend called and tried to find some other places for us to stay, but to no avail. After going through our options we found a hiker friendly restaurant that let people sleep on its floor. Unfortunately the floor was full. So that's how I ended up spending a night sleeping on the floor of a kitchen shed. </p><figure>    <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180408_100314-375x500.jpg\">    <figcaption>Home Sweet Home.</figcaption></figure><h2>Hike For Mental Health</h2><p>Lastly I want to thank everyone who has donated to my Hike For Mental Health page!

We were picked up by a young couple, Anwar and Claudia, who seemed even happier to be driving us than we were to be getting a ride. They asked all about the PCT- where it went, how long we had been out there, the gear we needed, and more. Anwar shared with us a map of destinations he plans on checking out throughout the country since his recent release from the military. After hearing about our trek through the Anza-Borrego desert, they wanted to hike it that day. They were a couple out to find adventure with no time limit or boundaries holding them back.</p><p>They dropped us off right where we left the day before. We thanked them for the ride and they thanked us for the inspiration. Anwar and Claudia drove off and we were back on the trail again.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180417_063724-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Trekking through the Anza-Borrego desert\"><figcaption>Back to the Anza-Borrego desert.</figcaption></figure><h2>Gradient Ecosystems</h2><p>That night we setup on a ridgeline over the desert where we watched the sun set behind one mountain range and later rise over another. Over the next couple of days we made the push to Warner Springs, the next town on our list.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180417_064534-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset over the desert\"><figcaption>Watching the sun set over the desert.</figcaption></figure><p>The desert slowly became lusher and lusher as we made our way into the San Felipe hills. The barren spaces between the cactuses started to fill up with small plants. The plants became bushes, and the bushes eventually became trees. Before we knew it we were passing in and out of small forests. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180418_191417-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Forest near Warner Springs\"><figcaption>Not so desert looking anymore.</figcaption></figure><p>We were coming out of yet another small patch of forest when suddenly we weren't in the desert at all anymore. In front of us laid a wide open field of grass, continuing for miles over rolling hills. It felt like I was in The Sound of Music. In the distance we could see hundreds of cows grazing peacefully. It was crazy to think we had been in a barren, lifeless desert only a day ago. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180418_191756-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"A lone tree in the field\"><figcaption>A lone tree sitting in one of the vast fields. I <em>had</em> to walk off trail to take a picture of it, both for me and for my girlfriend back home who loves trees.</figcaption></figure><h2>An Unexpected Hiker Oasis</h2><p>Walking through a patch of forest only a couple miles from Warner Springs, I encountered my biggest trail hazard yet. Standing before me and directly on my path was an intimidatingly large herd of cows.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180418_192232-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"Cows along the Pacific Crest Trail\"><figcaption>Please moooove out of my way.</figcaption></figure><p>They seemed content to completely ignore me, chomping away at some seemingly delicious grass while I pondered how to get around them. However as soon as I got within 15 feet of them they would all stop and stare directly at me. Being a suburban kid with little-to-no farm experience, I wasn't totally sure what to do when a herd of 20 cows all had their focus on me. Another hiker came up behind me who seemed to have had prior experience with trail cows. He started banging his poles together and the cows slowly trotted away until we could eventually continue to our destination.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180418_192616-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Herding cows off the Pacific Crest Trail\"><figcaption>Herding the cows.</figcaption></figure><p>The area of Warner Springs that Dennis and I stayed at was a school turned hiker oasis. A section of their athletic field was set aside for hikers to setup tents in, they had converted classrooms into hiker hangout spaces, and closets were stocked with hiker food and supplies for purchase.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180418_192805-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Sunrise at Warner Springs\"><figcaption>Sunrise at Warner Springs.</figcaption></figure><p>It was here that I learned of a 'bucket shower'. It is exactly what it sounds like- you fill a bucket with (cold) water then dump it on yourself to take a shower. Having been denied a shower for nearly a week, if pouring cold gallons of water on myself was the best I could get, I sure was going to take it. </p><h2>Chain Link Fences, Thoreau, and Water Troughs</h2><p>The next few days became a hard push to get to the city of Idyllwild. The miles we did each day were dependent on where we could find water as we weaved between forests and cismontane chaparral.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180418_193425-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Cloudy day in the desert of the PCT\"><figcaption>Just because it's the desert doesn't mean we don't get any cold and cloudy days. The sun is the only thing providing any heat out there!</figcaption></figure><p>The first night we stayed at Mike's Place. It was this small trailer park/shack, alone in the middle of the mountains, accessible only by a beaten up dirt road. The area was littered with the trash of forgotten dreams. I pitched my tent next to some rusted and decaying workout equipment. I fell asleep to the sound of howling winds smacking against chain link fences guarding nothing.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180418_193716-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Decaying bench press\"><figcaption>Real men use splintery half benches to get swol.</figcaption></figure><p>Another night we stayed at Muir Ranch, also known as Mary's Water Tank. It was a quaint little spot with a mini free library and wooden cutouts of famous outdoorsmen, such as John Muir and Thoreau. On another night we drank out of a water trough fed from an underground spring.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180418_204807-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"A water trough on the Pacific Crest Trail\"><figcaption>Delicious. (It was actually very fresh and clean tasting!)</figcaption></figure><h2>The Fire Closure</h2><p>Right before heading into Idyllwild there was a 10 mile section of the trail that was closed due to forest fire damage. Leading up to the closure was one of the steepest sections we had the entire trip- 1200 feet of elevation gained in only 2 miles. It was also one of my favorite sections of the trail, as the ecosystem became that out of a thick forest that reminded me of the woods back home in New England.<figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180418_200134-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"A giant pine cone\"><figcaption>The pine trees have GIANT pine cones. Some can get up to 5lbs in weight. I carried one out as a gift for my girlfriend.</figcaption></figure>Sadly the scars of the fire started to show through as the brilliant trees were slowly replaced with the charred husks of vegetation past. We continued our hard push upward, sweating and breathing heavily the whole way. Our reward? A brief view of the Salton Sea followed by going all the way back down and then some.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180418_200552-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Fire scarred forests\"><figcaption>Imagine how lush this would have been were it not for the forest fire. I believe this one was actually started by someone who didn't fully put out their camp fire (some are started naturally, such as from lightning).</figcaption></figure><p>We took an alternate route around the closure into Idyllwild where we ended up resting and taking some time off for a day and a half. Dennis even met the mayor! I was a little jealous, seeing as the mayor is a golden retriever wearing a tie (he was officially elected into office).</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180418_201155-500x490.jpg\" alt=\"Mayor Max of Idyllwild, CA\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://mayormax.com/\">I'm not joking.</a> Photo taken by Dennis Anderson.</figcaption></figure><p>Idyllwild was a cool little town, on the weekend it was buzzing with people going in and out of coffee shops, restaurants, and trinket stores. It felt like we could have been somewhere in Boston only in a forest. But then as soon as the weekend ended, the place felt like a ghost town. All the tourists had gone and all the shops had closed. We grabbed some good food and made some gear upgrades, all the while Mount San Jacinto (and it's over 6000 feet of elevation gain) loomed over the town, ready for us to take it on following our time off. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180418_202301-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Mount San Jacinto\"><figcaption>Mount San Jacinto stands at over 10,880 feet above sea level, and from the top you look straight down at the desert floor at 170 feet above sea level.</figcaption></figure>"

                     "__cdata": "<p>As we looked at the map in preparation for our ascent up Mount San Jacinto, we planned three distinct days - an up day, a down day, and a flat day. The up day was going to be from Idyllwild up to the summit of San Jacinto, followed by the down day as we would make our way to the desert floor, and than finally the flat day as we crossed the desert to the next mountain range. We were excited at the idea that each day would be a little easier then the last.</p><p>Boy were we wrong.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180424_192834-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>They warned us about San Jacinto, but not what came after it.</figcaption></figure><h2>It's a Long Way Up</h2><p>Idyllwild to San Jacinto was over 6000 feet of straight uphill hiking. That's not including any small up and downs that we did, that's just the net gain from Idyllwild to Jacinto. Most of the trail was on alternate, non-PCT routes, as sections of the trail in that area were closed due to a forest fire several years ago and Jacinto itself isn't officially on the PCT. So that meant the whole \"incline designed for horses\" was not in existence for this section. Instead it often felt like we were going straight up, similar to the hiking I get back in the White Mountains.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180424_193328-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The open and gradual desert was replaced with steep lush pine forests.</figcaption></figure><p>To add to the difficulty, it was very cold. Like wear-all-your-layers cold. With the constant incline we'd be sweating and over heating like crazy, and then as soon as we stopped the cold air on our wet clothes would send chills through our bodies.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180424_194152-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>There were some big trees. See if you can spot Dennis.</figcaption></figure><p>The difficulty did not come without it's rewards though. The hike up lead us through gorgeous pine forests where the smell of pine and the sounds of birds chirping provided a sense of relaxation through the pain. And then came the view from the summit- standing at 10,834 feet, we could look straight down to the desert floor, over 9000 feet below us. It was absolutely breathtaking, and something I highly recommend to anyone who finds themselves in the area. There is also a <a href=\"https://www.pstramway.com\">tramway</a> that takes you part way up the mountain.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180424_194645-375x500.jpg\"><figcaption>Dennis holding the summit sign in victory. The desert view behind him was over 9000 feet below us.</figcaption></figure><p>After taking in the view we made our way off the summit to find a campsite. We descended back into the pine forests, and this time we were treated to the evening sun bathing the trail in orange as it peered through the branches of the trees. We reached a small boulder field and pitched our tents as we watched the sun set over the desert 9000 feet below us, knowing we would be heading right behind it as soon as we got up the next morning.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180424_195329-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The evening sun through the trees. </figcaption></figure><h2>All Downhill From Here</h2><p>After a grueling uphill day, we were excited for a day of all downhill. \"No cardio\", we thought, \"that'll go by so fast!\" The only problem was there wasn't any water for the next 20 miles, so our goal was to go the whole length to the next water source so we wouldn't have to carry water for cooking and cleaning that night.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180425_195537-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>We're going allllll the way down there. And then we're going up those mountains a little bit later.</figcaption></figure><p>At first it was everything we had hoped. We were cruising down quickly with the coolness of the early morning temperatures. But as the miles went from 3 to 5 to 10, our feet and legs started to feel the effects of losing nearly 500 feet every mile. Soon we were out of the shade filled forests and back into the exposed chaparral. The morning cool made way for the hot desert sun and our quick, excited pace turned to a sweat-filled and foot swelling tromp as we continued our descent.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180425_210653-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The desert in the spring is home to some brilliant wild flowers.</figcaption></figure><p>When we finally reached the desert floor, we were even more sore then the day before. Ready to pass out, we setup our tents, cooked our dinners, and headed to sleep. Sleep that would only last a few hours.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180425_211403-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>At long last the desert floor.</figcaption></figure><h2>Desert Winds: The Sequel</h2><p>A few hours after hitting the sack, the desert winds started to pick up. At first they were small gusts, ruffling the outside cover of my tent. But the gusts got bigger and bigger as the relaxing breeze quickly evolved into hurricane force winds.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180425_211906-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>All the wind farms we saw in the distance should have warned us.</figcaption></figure><p>I was awakened to the top of my tent wacking my body. It was still standing (I learned to put rocks over my stakes after the <a href=\"http://reconnect.life/2018/04/08/pct-update-1-wind-and-banjos/\">last time my tent collapsed</a>), but the force was so strong the poles bent inwards and flattened the tent over me. The gust would pass after a minute or two, then there were would be calm again for a little while. Then I would hear what sounded like the shrill cry of a banshee in the distance and thirty seconds later my tent would be inverted into my face again.</p><p>When morning finally came, I packed my stuff up (with my tent still routinely falling in on me as I did) and made my way over to Dennis only to find his night was significantly worse then mine. Not only did he suffer the same tent flattening winds, the winds caused one of his poles to pop out and ripped a hole through the top of his tent. He told me all of this while the wind pushed the tent into a Dennis shaped silhouette around him. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180425_212558-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>In the distance we could see the storm that brought the wind. And the trail was set to go straight into it.</figcaption></figure><h2>Desert Winds: The Sequel Part 2</h2><p>After a hard climb the first day, a draining downhill the second, the third day was supposed to be our flat and easy day. But the winds from the night only got stronger as the day went on. What should have been smooth walking turned into a wrestling match with the weather.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180426_193332-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The eye of the storm.</figcaption></figure><p>When the wind wasn't knocking us off the trail from the side, we were walking straight into it. You know when a dog sticks it's head out the window of a car and it's face gets all stretched and pulled back? That was how our entire day was. Several times I had to stop and lock my hiking poles in the ground and just brace myself until the gust passed by.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180426_193845-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>We eventually got away from the clouds, but the wind followed us the whole day. This is one of the few pictures I managed to capture, as the winds were often too strong to be able to risk taking my phone out.</figcaption></figure><p>That afternoon we came across a literal oasis in the desert. We descended down into a canyon where we reached a small nature preserve with a river running through it. There were palm trees and green meadows and wading pools. There was a visitor center for us to charge our electronics and bathrooms with running water. After the crazy weather we had been battling all day, it felt like a place out of a fairy tail. We decided to call it a day and stayed in the grassy meadow, sheltered from the storm above.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180426_195000-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>After hiking through a barren desert for a couple days, suddenly walking through a green tunnel over streams of water felt like it was too good to be true.</figcaption></figure><h2>Lions and Tigers and Bears, Oh My!</h2><p>The next few days on our way to Big Bear Lake went a bit smoother. After leaving the oasis, we followed the same river for about 20 miles. All around us in the distance were barren mountains, yet right along the river was filled with beautiful deciduous trees and tall grasses. We could hear insects and birds and life. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180426_195628-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Would you believe this was in the middle of a desert?</figcaption></figure><p>As we were nearing the town, we suddenly found ourselves face to face with a grizzly bear. No, two grizzly bears! Wait, there was a Tiger as well! These animals posed us no harm as they were actually behind fences inside of a private zoo. Each animal sat alone in a cage about the size of a bedroom, it was actually rather depressing.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180426_195911-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>These animals do not belong in cages. Although the way this tiger was eyeing me I was glad there was something between us.</figcaption></figure><p>We eventually reached Big Bear Lake where we enjoyed some good eating and rest and relaxation. It gets it's name from all the bears that live there. Or rather used to live there. The last grizzly in the area was hunted down back in the 30's, leaving the town name more as a memorial to what it once was. Sadly the lake has also been shrinking due to the drought, so hopefully they get some rain before Big Bear Lake becomes both bear-less and lake-less.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180426_200438-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Mountains, forest, water, and a town. Something for everyone at Big Bear Lake!</figcaption></figure><p>It was a cool little tourist town with lots of trinket shops and restaurants. We didn't spend too much time there. I picked up my resupply box full of treats from my girlfriend and we were back on the trail again, this time with our sights on the town of Wrightwood.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSX_20180426_201400-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>On the road again.</figcaption></figure><p>I want to again thank everyone who has donated to Hike For Mental Health! As of reaching Big Bear Lake, I am just over 10% done with the hike, yet we've already reached 75% of the fundraising goal!

This next section marked the last big climb of the desert portion of the PCT. The next time we would reach elevations of the likes of Mount San Jacinto and Mount Baden-Powell would be in the Sierra Nevada.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_180900-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>We started saying our goodbyes to the forests for a bit.</figcaption></figure><p>As we hit the ground running we knocked out a couple of back to back 19 mile days. This consistent speed was a new record for us, and one that we anticipated to keep breaking. While we were strongly motivated to complete the last of the three big climbs, this time around we had a handful of treats lying along the way.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180425_020627-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The goodbyes went well into the night.</figcaption></figure><h2>RoboCop</h2><p>Once again we found ourselves meandering between pine trees and cactuses as the alpine forests faded into desert with our loss of elevation. Water and shade became luxuries we planned our days around. To no surprise, the water sources with the most shade ended up where you would run into other hikers hanging about.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_183313-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>One such watering hole.</figcaption></figure><p>It was at one of these watering holes that we met RoboCop for the first time. He was a boisterous former sheriff who was on his fourth PCT hike and had previously done both the Appalachian Trail and the Continental Divide Trail. This time around he was a going a bit slower thanks to that whole aging thing. He told us embellished stories from his previous trips about getting into fights with rangers and helping out fellow hikers. We know they were embellished because he told us they were. After spending some time chatting and snacking, we finally filled up our water bottles and moved on, wondering if we would meet RoboCop again. </p><h2>Deep Creek</h2><p>Back home there's a place called Inman Oasis that I frequent with my girlfriend. True to the 'oasis' concept, it's a public hot tub set in a relaxing atmosphere. It offers a zen filled break from the bustle of life in the city around it. I know I've mentioned finding oasises in the desert before, but this time we found one that keeps in line with what the Inman Oasis does so well. This was the Deep Creek Hot Springs.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_183626-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>All day under the desert sun makes any water sound fantastic.</figcaption></figure><p>Deep Creek Hot Springs is a sanctuary set miles from any civilization. After hiking all day in the desert, we suddenly came across a cold river wide enough and deep enough you could swim in it. Sure enough, plenty of people were. This area was teaming with hikers, all looking for a break from the endless walking.</p><p>The river was far from the main attraction though. Coming out of the ground all around the area was multiple hot springs, each one dammed up with stone walls. These springs were heated to the perfect temperatures to create a natural hot tub in the middle of the wilderness.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_184401-500x353.jpg\"><figcaption>A natural hot tub.</figcaption></figure><p>I dipped my feet in to see what it was like, and sure enough it was everything I had heard it would be. Unfortunately I had also heard it was filled with bacteria seeing as it was routinely filled with dirty hikers and unlike Inman Oasis, there was no chlorine to keep it sanitary. Sorry for the buzzkill. </p><h2>The Silverwood Lake Rabbit</h2><p>We continued through the desert as we made our way to the Mojave dam. At one point the heat of the desert sun (94°) and a lack of drinking enough water got to me as I started to feel fatigued and headachey. Thankfully some shade and water got me back on my feet in no time.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_185852-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>We carry umbrellas not for rain but for portable shade.</figcaption></figure><p>We kept pushing through the desert for a couple of days when we unexpectedly came across Silverwood Lake. As we came over the crest of yet another barren mountain ridge, we were suddenly greeted by a massive lake with lush pine forests rising around all sides of it and sandy beaches along it's edges. We circled the lake for the remainder of the day as we made our way closer to our campsite.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_190351-500x345.jpg\"><figcaption>Silverwood Lake sits between the mountains in the distance.</figcaption></figure><p>It was here that I saved a baby bunny's life. I was nearing the tent site when the little guy ran out in front of me and skittered away into the bushes. Shortly after that I heard what sounded like a distressed squeal, which I just assumed was out of it's fear of me. I was going to keep going but decided to go look anyways. To my surprise, the bunny was caught in the coil of an insidious snake. I went to grab a stick to throw at it, and as soon as the snake saw me move it bolted and the rabbit ran free. He sat there shaking for a bit before running off to find his rabbit friends and some delicious grass to munch on. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_190715-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>It all happened to quickly for a picture, but here's some of the beautiful forest we had around the lake.</figcaption></figure><h2>I'm Loving It</h2><p>The next morning we got up before the break of dawn and we're back on the trail while the Moon was still our light source. We had a goal in mind, a promise of a deliciously gourmet lunch. For 13 miles away, there was a McDonald's just a short ways off the trail.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_180707-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The early morning light shines through the Flora.</figcaption></figure><p>We meandered through mountains and deserts. Past lakes and through canyons. All with the thought of a juicy Big Mac and a side of fries drifting through our heads. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_191102-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Not your typical route to McDonald's.</figcaption></figure><p>The McDonald's was located at Cajon Pass, a major intersection for transportation. There was a 4 lane highway filled with cars flying by in all directions. A little ways in the distance was what appeared to be several unending freight trains, slowly chugging towards their destinations. And then there was the PCT and it's hikers, all congregating at this interstate rest stop.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_191204-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>They're even on a trail sign!</figcaption></figure><h2>Strawberry</h2><p>After our fast food indulgence (which even Dennis, Mr. Superfood, thoroughly enjoyed) we decided to stay the night at the Best Western along the freeway. The most exciting thing about it? They had a hot tub. Unlike Deep Creek Hot Springs, this one was fully chlorinated and bacteria free!</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_191357-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Unending trains and the highway in the distance.</figcaption></figure><p>We were joined by these two German section hikers in the hot tub. They went by the names of Guitar and Princess. We shared a couple of beers and a couple of stories about hiking and our countries (they get like 6 weeks vacation minimum over there!)</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_191534-500x372.jpg\"><figcaption>Certainly beats another windstorm!</figcaption></figure><p>The exciting hiking stories turned sad, however, as they recounted their time hiking a section of the PCT last year. They had become good friends with a Japanese girl who went by the name of Strawberry. Strawberry had become well known amongst hikers as she was one of two girls who passed away from drowning while crossing a river during the summer of 2017. </p><p>Guitar and Princess had been hiking with her since day one, and stayed with her for a month before they had to fly back to Germany. A few weeks later Strawberry stayed behind while the rest of the group she was with went ahead. The next day she went missing, it was her first time ever hiking alone. </p><p>There is a YouTube video that Dennis and I had watched that was uploaded in Strawberry's honor back when the event happened. She was sitting there listening to a man play the guitar. We found out that the video was uploaded by Guitar himself, and that was him playing in it. It was a very chilling moment to be so close to a tragedy we had only ever read about online. </p><h2>Oodles of Poodles</h2><p>The next morning we had waffles for breakfast at the hotel. A carb surplus would do us well as we set forth on a two day stretch of all uphill. We quickly found ourselves face to face with an unexpected obstacle- the dreaded Poodle Dog Bush. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_193041-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The uphill wasn't the only thing working against us.</figcaption></figure><p>Poodle Dog Bush is an evil plant. It is poisonous, with skin rashes comparable or worse than that of poison oak. The top leaves are green, but the leaves below are all gray, wilted, and dead. This, combined with the fact that it grows outwards up to several meters in length, gives it an appearance like it's reaching for life while everything beneath it dies. It only grows in recent forest fires, so often times it will be standing amongst a forest of blackened tree carcasses. On top of all that, it has a rank smell that fills the air. There is no mistake that a Poodle Dog Bush is nearby. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_194225-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>It's coming for you...</figcaption></figure><p>The PDB was overgrown in this section of the trail. There were stems reaching out from the sides as if it was trying to grab you and pull you in. In other spots there was smaller growths directly in the center of the path. It felt like one of those dodge the laser games you play at an arcade, only instead of losing an few quarters you end up with severe skin burns.</p><h2>Above It All</h2><p>The one sure way to escape inclement weather is to be above it. Sure enough that's just what we did. As we made our way higher and higher, we were treated to some brilliant undercast. Everyone down below was likely complaining about the cold and cloudy day, but their misery was our picturesque day of hiking. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_194530-500x338.jpg\"><figcaption>It feels like you're gazing over the ocean, but the waves are in white and in slow motion.</figcaption></figure><p>We finally made it to the town of Wrightwood and treated ourselves to some delicious all you can eat Mexican food. A day off was in order too, as we had been going strong for several weeks.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_194923-375x500.jpg\"><figcaption>I also met a friendly black lab named Jessie while talking on the phone with my girlfriend, also Jessie.</figcaption></figure><p>The morning before we headed back on the trail we went for breakfast at the only place open that early of a time. While we waited to place our order, another hiker walked in, and it was none other than RoboCop. </p><p>We invited him to join us and got to chatting. He told us more of his exciting and embellished stories. But the more we talked the more we got to know the real man behind all the bravado. Of his four kids, two had passed away. One at birth and the other drowned at age 5. Shortly after his wife left him, claiming he reminded her too much of the son they had lost. RoboCop was out here not so much for the adventure, but for the peace he could find only from getting away.</p><p>After our breakfast we said farewell, not knowing if we would cross paths again. RoboCop went back to his hotel room and Dennis and I headed down to the road to get a hitch back to the trail.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_195402-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Waiting for a hitch.</figcaption></figure><h2>'Twas a Dark and Stormy Night</h2><p>Our luck with sunshine ran out that day. We were dropped off at the trail head amidst a dense fog. It was so cold, the dew on the trees had frozen and the pine needles had become icicles. It was going to be even colder at the summit of Mount Baden-Powell. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_200109-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Into the abyss.</figcaption></figure><p>We pushed fast, I didn't see Dennis for the rest of the day. Every time I stopped to wait I would start to get chills after few minutes and had to keep moving to stay warm.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_200345-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>It looks cold. It felt colder.</figcaption></figure><p>I reached the summit and enjoyed the stark whiteness alone. On a clear day you can see for miles in all directions. On one side is Los Angeles, and to other the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. But that day there was only white. I started to get cold and continued on my way. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_200617-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Baden-Powell was the founder of the boy scouts.</figcaption></figure><p>That night we camped by a parking lot high up in the mountains. The fog turned to a light freezing rain and my tent was unable to handle it. Drips started leaking through the rain cover, threatening to soak my sleeping bag and my one way of staying warm. Dennis helped me rapidly move my tent and all of my stuff to a more protected location under some trees. That helped with the ceiling, but that night water continued to leak in through the floor. Needles to say I will be getting a new tent and writing a very poor review of this one. </p><h2>Stairway to Heaven</h2><p>The next morning we awoke to an inch of snow on the ground and on the outside of our tents. We packed them away, full of an extra 2lbs of frozen water. As we continued onward, we were treated to a brilliant clearing of the storm. The views from the fog lifting topped the amazing undercast from a few days before.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_202055-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>I felt like I was in a world that only exists in dramatic movie trailers.</figcaption></figure><p>We continued downward, and as we moved further from the high summits we could see first hand how deserts are formed. All morning we had been hiking in snow, but just a few miles into the other side of the ridgeline, the ground was as dry as could be. In one direction there were brilliant clouds and snow covered trees, the other way were bushes and dirt slowly transitioning into a barren desert. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_202248-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The snow was gone as soon as we made it over to the other side.</figcaption></figure><p>With Baden-Powell complete, we were done with all of the three big climbs of the desert section. The environment did another one of it's now familiar changes as the forests turned bushes and cactuses. The next point on our horizon was a little place known as Hiker Heaven. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180504_202605-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Until we reach Hiker Heaven, I'm satisfied with this as my bedtime view. </figcaption></figure>"

Run by a couple of \"trail angels\" out of their own home is Hiker Heaven, and a heaven it is indeed. They have yurts setup with everything from hangout spaces to computer rooms. They do your laundry for you and act as a psuedo post office, receiving and sending mail for hikers. They have a shuttle to ferry hikers in and out of town, offer showers, an air conditioned guest house, and plenty of space to setup a tent for the night or three. And they do it all for free out of the kindness of their heart. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_125646-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>On my way to Hiker Heaven I had to walk through a long dark tunnel with a light at the end of... wait a second...</figcaption></figure><p>After a couple of long days trekking down from Mount Baden-Powell and through the desert, Hiker Heaven offered a great recharge point for Dennis and I. I would've liked to have stayed there for days, but unfortunately my time in heaven was limited to only a few hours. I had miles to make that very night, as it was to be the beginning of my death march marathon. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_130024-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>If these rocks look familiar it's because you've probably seen them on Mars. Or rather in a movie on Mars. This region near the Vasquez rocks has been used as a filming location for countless movies and TV shows.</figcaption></figure><h2>Farewell For Now</h2><p>The same was not true for Dennis. He would be staying in Hiker Heaven for another day or so while I went off ahead. This would be our first time apart after over a month of hiking together.</p><p>This plan was put in place in the days leading up to our arrival at Hiker Heaven. I was going home in two weeks for my sister's graduation and to spend some time with my family and my girlfriend. We wanted to be able to stay together for the next section of the trip, the Sierra Nevada, which is arguably the most dangerous and generally inadvisable to do alone.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_130554-500x455.jpg\"><figcaption>Hanging out with Dennis in one of the yurts.</figcaption></figure><p>I ran the numbers and figured if I could average a little over 21 miles a day I could make it to a further highway crossing and be a about a week ahead of Dennis when I left for home. This would make meeting up significantly easier when I returned to the trail. It also meant I was about to push myself to my record high every day for nearly two weeks without a break, and after coming off of a week of hitting close to 20 miles a day average. But I was determined to succeed at this challenge.</p><p>After a few hours in Hiker Heaven we said our goodbyes for now. It was sad to walk out the door without Dennis. We had been through this journey together from the start and it felt weird to suddenly be without my hiking companion.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_130844-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Going off solo.</figcaption></figure><p>That evening I literally hiked off into the sunset. A brilliant red filled the sky as I ascended over desert peaks and into the green valley on the other side. I camped completely alone for the first time since I set off on this trip. The rustling of animals in the bushes combined with the solitude and a complete lack of phone service led to an uneasiness that night.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_131143-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Possibly one of the most vibrant sunsets I've ever seen.</figcaption></figure><h2>Never Truly Alone</h2><p>The next day proved to be the hardest for me yet. I saw almost nobody, and of the few I did see there was little more than passive greetings exchanged. On top of that I had little to no service for most the day. I felt very alone.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_131752-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>I started the day in a place called Green Valley.</figcaption></figure><p>I meandered up and down mountains, all the while the sun bore down on me getting hotter with every hour. Water was scarce, and I was pushing for 27 miles, a soon-to-be new record. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_142756-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Green Valley didn't stay green the whole time.</figcaption></figure><p>The heat, thirst, and solitude drained my mind as much as my body. Motivation became harder and my speed began to slow. As the mid afternoon hit I was wiped, and I still had 7 miles to go, all uphill. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_132127-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>There were also a lot of snakes. A few minutes after passing this huge guy a rattlesnake took me by surprise as it hissed and rattled while slithering sideways off the trail and into the bushes.</figcaption></figure><p>It was around then that I had a couple bars of cell service. Not much, but enough to make a phone call as long I didn't move. I called my girlfriend, Jessie. We talked and laughed, and it was exactly what I needed. After the conversation my mental state did a 180, and the next 7 miles ended up my fastest of the day.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_132630-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>After starting in Green Valley I had made my down into a more desert region. But I ended the day back up in a green and grassy forest.</figcaption></figure><h2>Into the Mojave</h2><p>The next day I descended down into the Mojave desert. It was another long day, this time the physical pain being the harder to overcome then the mind. Near the end I popped some Tylenol and ibuprofen to make it through the last few miles. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_133211-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The southern edge of the Mojave desert.</figcaption></figure><p>That night I stayed at a place called Hiker Town along the southern edge of the Mojave desert. It was a sketchy place that was modeled after an old Western town. It was complete with buildings like the sheriff's office and the cat house. And just like those old Western towns, the place felt totally abandoned and rundown.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_133543-500x342.jpg\"><figcaption>Hiker Town.</figcaption></figure><p>I woke up and got ready to go still under the light of the stars. I was planning on hiking over 30 miles that day and completing the entire Mojave section of the trail in a single go.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_133830-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Day breaks over the desert.</figcaption></figure><p>Hiking alone under the stars in the wide expanse of the desert was an experience I will never forget. I felt like a renegade as I hiked swiftly along the flat terrain in the coolness of the night sky. I could see day break miles away as the sun slowly made it's way into the sky. I passed through forests of Joshua Trees, which under the shadows of the sunrise looked like they could've been a thousand people dancing.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_134216-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Joshua Trees dance under the morning sun.</figcaption></figure><p>I put many miles in before the same old desert sun came bearing down in full force. The trail weaved through wind farms where hundreds of turbines sat, ready to take advantage of those extreme desert winds. However that day they were motionless, leaving me to complete my Mojave march without so much as a breeze to cool me down.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_134547-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>A windless wind farm. </figcaption></figure><h2>Far Away From Home</h2><p>Over the next day I made my way to the town of Tehachapi. I hitched in, resupplied and did laundry, and then hitched back to the trail a few hours later. There was no time to rest as I had many more miles to go.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_134824-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>It's a little known fact that dinosaurs still roam the PCT.</figcaption></figure><p>This next section came with a warning to expect \"little to no cell service or water.\" It was to be the most remote section of the trail yet. It was also my last 85 miles before I would reach the highway and begin my journey home. The last hoorah of the desert.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_135036-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Barren but beautiful.</figcaption></figure><p>Winding up and over mountain after mountain, the trail became more and more remote with each mile. At the beginning I was still amongst some lingering wind turbines from the wind farms of the desert, but those quickly faded away. Wilderness reached out all around me with the only signs of civilization being other hikers and the occasional ATV road cutting across the trail. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_135436-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The desert stretched out for what looked like forever.</figcaption></figure><h2>Twenty Percent</h2><p>As I neared the end of this stretch, the peaks of the Sierra Nevada rose above all else in the distance. Their summits were blanketed in snow and surrounded by the only clouds in the sky. It was a teaser for what was to come upon my return to the trail.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_140219-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>My last sunrise for now.</figcaption></figure><p>Tired and weary, I made my way to the highway that marked the end of this section. A trail angel had stashed some beers for hikers to have for celebration. I cracked open a Guinness to drink while I waited for a hitch into town. The beer was hot from the sun, yet after all these miles it was... gross. Hot beer never tastes good.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_135919-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Beautiful wildflowers lined the trail on the way down.</figcaption></figure><p>It wasn't long before a nice couple pulled over to drive me into town. As we drove off, I felt a sense of completion. The hike was now 20% done, I had completed the desert section of the Pacific Crest Trail. When I come back I will be entering the Sierra Nevada where new terrain and challenges await. But for now I looked forward to some time of rest and to get to see my family and my girlfriend.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180515_140428-1-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>I'll be back.</figcaption></figure>"

There were some pieces that shined greater than expected and others that wound up complete duds. Now that I have a greater understanding of what works for me, I will also be making some adjustments as I move forward into the Sierra Nevada. There is also a handful of additional items I will need to prepare for the terrain and wildlife of this coming section.<figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180529_125022-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>The desert was hot, cold, dry, and even occasionally wet.</figcaption></figure>For reference, here is my <a href=\"https://lighterpack.com/r/d6xzpo\">gear list that I started with</a>.

The extra half pound translated into increased comfort. I heard many hikers complain about awkward hip belts as a consequence of weight shaving with the lighter packs, and at the end of the day going ultralight is all about improving comfort. In that regard, an extra half pound for less back pain and hip chaffing is totally worth it.The pack itself is fantastic for organizing gear. There is one main compartment where the bulk of my stuff went, and then a few large outer mesh pockets and a handful of smaller compartments located along the straps and hip belts. I was able to load up the center compartment and then fill the remaining pockets and compartments with everything I needed quick access to.<h3>Watch - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Casio-PAG240T-7CR-Pathfinder-Triple-Sensor-Stainless/dp/B003MOIVI4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=apparel&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522180074&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=pathfinder+watch+PAG240T&amp;dpID=51bmBBr3z2L&amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=reconnectlife-20&amp;linkId=181dce44d391e5c9f5ed895c93abafab\">Casio Pathfinder PAG240</a></h3>Before hiking the Pacific Crest Trail I was not one to wear a watch, but now I feel naked without one. In addition to telling time, this watch can give me the temperature, elevation, barometric pressure, compass direction, and sunrise/sunset. It runs on solar power, is rugged, and waterproof.I was expecting to make good use of the barometric pressure to help predict the weather, but this ended up being rendered obsolete by the rapid changes in elevation. The trending pressure is great if you remain in a single area, but when you are traversing over mountains it tends to be all over the place.<figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180529_125511-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>My <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Casio-PAG240T-7CR-Pathfinder-Triple-Sensor-Stainless/dp/B003MOIVI4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=apparel&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522180074&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=pathfinder+watch+PAG240T&amp;dpID=51bmBBr3z2L&amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=reconnectlife-20&amp;linkId=181dce44d391e5c9f5ed895c93abafab\">Casio Pathfinder</a> reads exactly 10,000 feet as I make my way up to Mount San Jacinto.</figcaption></figure>On the other hand the elevation and temperature features proved to be great to have. I could look at my map on my phone and determine my current elevation and that of the next destination I was aiming for. With that knowledge I could check my progress towards the next water source/tentsite/McDonald’s with a simple flick of the wrist instead of having to pull my phone out.The temperature proved great for decision making throughout the day. I could determine how much water I might need or what layers to put on before getting out of my sleeping bag. I would also wake up throughout the night on colder nights and check it to decide if I should sleep with my water filter to keep it from freezing (and breaking).<h3>Umbrella - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Umbrellas-Liteflex-Umbrella-Silver-W2L69027-SILVER/dp/B001OPO7L8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522179149&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=ultralight+hiking+umbrella&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=reconnectlife-20&amp;linkId=deaa5a1101587ce375c749ebb8ba3356\">Liteflex Trekking Umbrella</a></h3>The desert sun is hot and the terrain offers little protection. Any bit of shade that can be found will be grabbed up like a diamond in a coal mine.Enter the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Umbrellas-Liteflex-Umbrella-Silver-W2L69027-SILVER/dp/B001OPO7L8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522179149&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=ultralight+hiking+umbrella&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=reconnectlife-20&amp;linkId=deaa5a1101587ce375c749ebb8ba3356\">Liteflex Trekking Umbrella</a>. It works as portable shade and makes the desert sun much more bearable. I can't imagine trying to get through the desert without one.<figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180529_125907-500x375.jpg\" /><figcaption>My <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Umbrellas-Liteflex-Umbrella-Silver-W2L69027-SILVER/dp/B001OPO7L8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522179149&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=ultralight+hiking+umbrella&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=reconnectlife-20&amp;linkId=deaa5a1101587ce375c749ebb8ba3356\">Liteflex trekking umbrella</a> hangs from a tree, providing me shade as I take a break.</figcaption></figure>The one downside is that it can be annoying to the use in the wind, and the desert has a lot of strong winds. It broke one of the joints on my umbrella, and once that went it made it even more susceptible to wind. It eventually resulted in another to break later on, rendering the umbrella close to useless as it couldn't support itself anymore. Thankfully that happened on the second to last day of the desert so I didn't have to travel far with it.<h3>Pants - <a href=\"https://www.rei.com/product/131001/rei-co-op-sahara-convertible-pants-mens\">REI Sahara Zip Off</a></h3>It was a week before I left for the PCT that I picked up these pants. I prefer hiking in shorts and I had a really light and comfortable pair that I was excited to bring. But the need for greater sun protection untimely brought me to reluctantly pick these up. Boy was I glad I did.They are extremely light and breathable, in shorts mode they barely felt any warmer than the running shorts I had wanted to bring. In pants mode they could still be worn on a hot desert day without feeling too sweaty and at the same time provided just enough insulation for the colder mornings I experienced. Being able to switch between pants and shorts without having to carry much extra weight proved to be a blessing.On the pants half there is a zipper that runs the whole height. This allows you to easily put them on and off without taking off your shoes. It also allows you to open them fully and allow air flow while hiking in hot weather. The feature was excellent for when I needed sun protection but still needed to keep my legs cool.<h3>Mid Layer - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ibex-Outdoor-Clothing-Sport-Komodo/dp/B01IHZ3RUY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521766642&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ibex+w2+hoodie&amp;dpID=41BG1cCg3EL&amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=reconnectlife-20&amp;linkId=18239b148d80d7d429b91d6e6948c6e1\">Ibex W2 Hoodie</a></h3>Unfortunately Ibex went out of business right after I purchased this, although you can still <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ibex-Outdoor-Clothing-Sport-Komodo/dp/B01IHZ3RUY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521766642&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ibex+w2+hoodie&amp;dpID=41BG1cCg3EL&amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=reconnectlife-20&amp;linkId=18239b148d80d7d429b91d6e6948c6e1\">find it on Amazon</a> as of writing this. It was a fantastic mid layer that I wore on the coldest days and on some of the hottest.<figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ibex-w2-hoodie-470x500.jpg\" alt=\"Ibex W2 Hoodie\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ibex-Outdoor-Clothing-Sport-Komodo/dp/B01IHZ3RUY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521766642&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ibex+w2+hoodie&amp;dpID=41BG1cCg3EL&amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=reconnectlife-20&amp;linkId=18239b148d80d7d429b91d6e6948c6e1\">Ibex W2 Hoodie</a></figcaption></figure>The insulation could keep me warm in the upper 30s without needing to put on my down jacket. But it was thin enough that I could use it as long sleeves for sun protection on hot days. It also has a thin hood that I could pull up over my baseball cap which would allow for either warmth or full head sun protection, depending on the situation.<h3>Satellite Messenger - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-010-01735-10-Inreach-Explorer/dp/B01MY03CZP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522179528&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=Garmin+inReach+&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=reconnectlife-20&amp;linkId=6400bdebc51fe4f752214262e4789a86\">Garmin InReach</a></h3>As I've written about before, I carry an actual <a href=\"http://reconnect.life/2018/03/30/pre-pct-gear-list/\">personal locator beacon for emergencies</a>. But I decided to bring a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-010-01735-10-Inreach-Explorer/dp/B01MY03CZP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522179528&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=Garmin+inReach+&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=reconnectlife-20&amp;linkId=6400bdebc51fe4f752214262e4789a86\">Garmin InReach</a> for it's additional communication benefits. It proved to be an excellent addition for the people back home.<figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180529_153907-288x500.jpg\"><figcaption>A look what my family and girlfriend got to see every night.</figcaption></figure>Each night I would send my girlfriend and family my location and they loved being able to watch my progress change in real time. They would know things about the trail that I wouldn't even know, like what towns were nearby and the next highways I would be going along. It also let me finish up conversations that might've ended short due to a sudden loss of phone service. I am glad to have it as I enter into the Sierra Nevada where phone service will be even more limited.<h2>The Unexpected Duds</h2><h3>Tent - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nemo-Hornet-Ultralight-Backpacking-Tent/dp/B00VXYNEZA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521763644&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=nemo+hornet+2p&amp;dpID=41ZiiquYCNL&amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=reconnectlife-20&amp;linkId=70f0788778c75632d048f0421d7afae2\">Nemo Hornet 2P</a></h3>Those who've been following my trip know by now that I've had <a href=\"http://reconnect.life/2018/05/05/pct-update-4-walking-through-the-clouds/\">many issues with my tent</a>. On the first night the floor tore open. A few nights later another small tear appeared. By the end of the first week the stuff sack was completely shredded. On the second week a large hole in the bug net along the seam appeared, followed by another hole a couple weeks later.In addition to the extremely frailty of the material, the tent was unable to handle any weather. It would collapse in the wind, and worse the rain cover couldn't keep out a drizzle of rain.<figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180529_130249-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nemo-Hornet-Ultralight-Backpacking-Tent/dp/B00VXYNEZA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521763644&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=nemo+hornet+2p&amp;dpID=41ZiiquYCNL&amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=reconnectlife-20&amp;linkId=70f0788778c75632d048f0421d7afae2\">Nemo Hornet 2P</a>.</figcaption></figure>On top of all that it was deceptively marketed and very uncomfortable. It claimed a 7.5 feet length, yet I at 5’10” had both my head and feet touching the ends. It's advertised as a 2 person tent yet a single standard sleeping pad fills the base of the tent. I barely fit with my gear. The claimed weight is just over 2lbs, but with the paper thin floor a <a href=\"http://reconnect.life/2018/02/23/9-ways-to-shed-pack-weight-for-almost-no-money/\">groundsheet such as Tyvek</a> is mandatory. Going no groundsheet or using the lighter polycryo will destroy the floor in days.I made it through the desert with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nemo-Hornet-Ultralight-Backpacking-Tent/dp/B00VXYNEZA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521763644&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=nemo+hornet+2p&amp;dpID=41ZiiquYCNL&amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=reconnectlife-20&amp;linkId=70f0788778c75632d048f0421d7afae2\">Nemo Hornet 2P</a>, but I am returning it under warranty due to all of it's issues. Replacing it is a new <a href=\"http://zpacks.com/shelter/duplex.shtml\">Zpacks Duplex</a>. It's an expensive tent, but the material it's made out of, cuben fiber, is <a href=\"https://andrewskurka.com/2017/cuben-fiber-backpack-shelter-worth-the-cost/\">15 times stronger than steel per pound</a>. Water cannot permeate it, and it uses hiking poles instead of separate tent poles to set up. All in all it will be lighter, more durable, and more waterproof than the tent I had.<h3>Sleeping Quilt - <a href=\"https://enlightenedequipment.com/enigma-850dt-20-charcoal-navy/\">Enlightened Equipment Enigma 20° Quilt</a></h3>Going into the PCT I succumbed to the ultralight hype train and decided to go with a sleeping quilt instead of a sleeping bag. A quilt is essentially half of a bag, the philosophy being the down compressed underneath you does not provide much insulation so you can remove it to save weight.<figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180529_130006-500x375.jpg\" /><figcaption>My tent setup with the <a href=\"https://enlightenedequipment.com/enigma-850dt-20-charcoal-navy/\">Enlightened Equipment Enigma 20° Quilt</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nemo-Hornet-Ultralight-Backpacking-Tent/dp/B00VXYNEZA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521763644&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=nemo+hornet+2p&amp;dpID=41ZiiquYCNL&amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=reconnectlife-20&amp;linkId=70f0788778c75632d048f0421d7afae2\">Nemo Hornet 2P</a>.</figcaption></figure>In theory this is great, in practice is a whole different story. The quilt works so long as you never move in your sleep. The moment you turn and the quilt gets an opening in it, the heat you've spent all night generating is gone in seconds. I had to purchase and carry an insulating sleeping bag liner to get by, as any night below 50 I would be up constantly due to the cold.I ended up ordering an <a href=\"https://enlightenedequipment.com/conundrum-850dt-10-black-purple/\">Enlightened Equipment Conundrum 10° Bag</a> to replace the quilt. The weight of it ended up less than the quilt plus the liner, and it keeps me warm all night long, no matter how much I might move around. I feel confident heading into the Sierra Nevada with this improved sleep system.<figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PSX_20180529_160754-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>Close up of the <a href=\"https://enlightenedequipment.com/conundrum-850dt-10-black-purple/\">Enlightened Equipment Conundrum 10° Bag</a>.</figcaption></figure><h3>Knife - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Gerber-Paraframe-Knife-Serrated-22-48445/dp/B000G0JI34/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522280350&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Gerber+Paraframe&amp;dpID=31xnYoO3lIL&amp;preST=_SX300_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=reconnectlife-20&amp;linkId=29a3823ee157b6167cf3803b562b2e0e\">Gerber Paraframe</a></h3>This one is a little different of a story. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Gerber-Paraframe-Knife-Serrated-22-48445/dp/B000G0JI34/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522280350&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Gerber+Paraframe&amp;dpID=31xnYoO3lIL&amp;preST=_SX300_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=reconnectlife-20&amp;linkId=29a3823ee157b6167cf3803b562b2e0e\">Gerber Paraframe knife</a> is a really great knife. It's size to weight ratio is great because it has an open body design. The openings also allow you to put it away wet or a little dirty with no risk of mold.The issue is that I lost the knife on my second week. I didn't end up getting a new one, and I found that I didn't really need one. If I wanted cheese or salami (the main reason I carried a knife) I could just pick up shredded cheese or sliced pepperoni.I will be bringing one into the Sierra however. I may not need it day to day, but I do feel it is an essential tool to carry in case of an emergency. I am replacing it with a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-Swiss-Climber-Pocket-Knife/dp/B00DMXFFHK\">small multi tool</a> my dad got me, which actually weighs a little less than the Gerber. I initially didn't think I would need the extra tools, but I had situations such as the screws loosening up on my poles or on my stove where a multi tool would have come in handy.<figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Swissarmyknife.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"402\" height=\"400\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-531\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-Swiss-Climber-Pocket-Knife/dp/B00DMXFFHK\">Swiss Army Knife Climber</a>.</figcaption></figure><h3>Storage - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LOKSAK-aLOKSAK-Waterproof-Bags-Multipack/dp/B001DPY6QK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522180440&amp;sr=1-1-spell&amp;keywords=opsakc&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=reconnectlife-20&amp;linkId=dcbcdf43b09fecf50d5ccb1817f75a17\">LOKSAK</a></h3>I had purchased a number of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LOKSAK-aLOKSAK-Waterproof-Bags-Multipack/dp/B001DPY6QK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522180440&amp;sr=1-1-spell&amp;keywords=opsakc&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=reconnectlife-20&amp;linkId=dcbcdf43b09fecf50d5ccb1817f75a17\">LOKSAKs</a> for my food, electronics, and first aid kit. They are advertised as durable, waterproof, and smell proof, all the things one could want for food and electronic storage.Water and smell proof they were, durable not so much. I have ziplock bags that lasted longer than some of them. The whole top part of every one of them is completely shredded. I am replacing them with <a href=\"http://www.zpacks.com/accessories/stuff_sacks.shtml\">Zpacks cuben fiber stuff sacks</a> as well as some other miscellaneous silnylon bags I had lying around.<h3>Chafe Relief - Gold Bond Powder</h3>I did pretty well with not getting much chafe. I am going to hold onto my Body Glide for another week or two, but that may be going as well.The one time I did get a little, the Gold Bond did not do much but to relieve it. There was about 20 minutes of soothing, but it quickly faded after that. On the other hand some baby diaper rash cream worked wonders and has since replaced the Gold Bond.<h3>Not Carrying a Windscreen</h3>This wasn't a gear failure but a failure due to a lack of gear. At the very beginning of the trip, my fuel unexpectedly ran out in a couple of days. Thankfully there was another hiker who had carried an extra canister and sold it to me, but I learned the inefficiencies of the wind from that. Going forward I made a windscreen out of cardboard and aluminum foil before ultimately getting a real one. My fuel usage has improved tremendously since then.<h2>Sierra Nevada Gear List</h2><h3>Snow Gear</h3>As I enter the Sierra Nevada, one of the biggest terrain changes will be having to deal with snow. This involves gear to improve traction, safety, and warmth.To help stay stable on slippery conditions I will be carrying a pair of <a href=\"https://www.rei.com/product/890608/kahtoola-microspikes-traction-system\">microspikes</a> with me. Snowshoes and crampons are both great tools for specific circumstances, but would be overkill for most of what I will be encountering.For added safety, I will be taking an <a href=\"https://www.rei.com/product/751753/camp-usa-corsa-ice-axe\">ice axe</a>. This tool is to be used like a hiking pole when I am on steeper terrain and as a means to stop a fall should that happen.<figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Campcorsaiceaxe-500x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-532\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rei.com/product/751753/camp-usa-corsa-ice-axe\">CAMP USA Corsa Ice Axe</a>.</figcaption></figure>For added warmth I will be adding <a href=\"https://www.rei.com/product/895247/outdoor-research-helium-rain-pants-mens\">rain pants</a> to my backcountry wardrobe as well as trading my <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Research-ActiveIce-Spectrum-Gloves/dp/B01MQHJVCI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522179229&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=outdoor+research+sun+gloves&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=reconnectlife-20&amp;linkId=2342cca49d4a4699281d0cc63035ee30\">sun gloves</a> for an <a href=\"https://www.ems.com/ems-men%E2%80%99s-power-stretch-glove/1291044.html\">actual pair of gloves</a>. I got away with not carrying the rain pants through the desert due to the extremely unlikelyhood of extended precipitation, but that changes now as I enter the Sierra. They will also work well to double as snow pants.<h3>Critter Protection</h3>Due to the increased water content from the snow, I will no longer be in the bug-less environment of the desert. In fact due to the rapid melting of snow, there can often be an extreme amount of bugs. For that I will be carrying a <a href=\"https://www.rei.com/product/799982/sea-to-summit-head-net-with-insect-shield\">bug net</a> with me.There is also the issues of bears, and because of that much of the Sierra requires all food to be stored in a bear canister. I will be carrying the 2 and a half pound <a href=\"https://www.rei.com/product/768902/bearvault-bv500-food-container\">BV500</a>, a not so fun addition to my pack weight.<figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bv500.jpg\"><figcaption>The <a href=\"https://www.rei.com/product/768902/bearvault-bv500-food-container\">BV500</a>.</figcaption></figure>For a complete break down of all the gear and it's weight, view my complete <a href=\"https://lighterpack.com/r/ewatn4\">Sierra Nevada gear list</a>."

This was it, I had at last arrived in Kennedy Meadows.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_055555-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The trail approaching Kennedy Meadows.</figcaption></figure><p>I made my way about a mile down the road when suddenly I hear clapping and a congratulatory \"Woooo!\" not to far away from me. Low and behold it's Dennis! Standing beneath a small cluster of trees in an otherwise shadeless region, he had been awaiting my arrival that day after having been in Kennedy Meadows by himself for the past 5 days.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_055910-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Walking along the one paved road.</figcaption></figure><p>We made our way to the General Store, also known as the only store in this town with a population of less than 200. The General Store is the main place where all of the hikers congregate before heading off into the Sierra. They sell burgers, beer, and expired dehydrated meals for hikers to take on the go.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_060149-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>They also have a lot of puppies and dogs. Pictured here is Dennis playing with the smallest of said puppies.</figcaption></figure><p>After we did some catching up and drinking some fitting Sierra Nevada beers, we started to formulate our plan for the coming section. We had two options to decide between. The first was to carry enough food for only a few days but we would have to spend two or more days just to go into a town to resupply and then back onto the trail. The second was to pack enough food for 13 days and go straight through the High Sierra in a single go, resupplying at a small resort connected to the trail by ferry at the end of the stretch.</p><p>We opted for choice 2.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_060417-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Here we come.</figcaption></figure><h2>Chicken Spring Lake</h2><p>As we made our climb out of Kennedy Meadows, we once again watched the desert chaparral slowly transition into pine forests. The difference was that this time it would be for good.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_062126-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Dennis sports a new hat. He hates it already.</figcaption></figure><p>For several days we walked through alternating wide open pine forests and vast grassy meadow. Occasionally we would see some distant rocky peaks, it was all quite beautiful. However this was not the Sierra we had been expecting.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_062539-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Rocky peaks jut out over open forests.</figcaption></figure><p>That started to change when we reached the questionably named Chicken Spring Lake. I hadn't heard of the Great Sierra Nevada Chicken before, so I wasn't sure where the name came from. Nevertheless, it was at this point when it finally began to feel like the High Sierra.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_062732-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>This meadow was filled with nesting birds under a nearby bridge.</figcaption></figure><p>Looming over the lake was a massive granite peak, flaked with bits of snow still waiting to melt. The water was ice cold, but that didn't stop us from jumping in. It would be the closest thing to a shower we'd get for the next 10 days. We camped by the lake that night, thinking we were finally in the Sierra we expected. In hindsight, Chicken Spring Lake and it's huge rocky peak would pale in comparison to what would come next.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_063025-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The dramatic Chicken Spring Lake.</figcaption></figure><h2>The High Points</h2><p>After the lake we made our way to the base of Mount Whitney. While not technically a part of the PCT, it is a must do trip that just about everyone does. At 14,505 feet, it is the tallest point in the lower 48 states. Being only 16 miles round-trip from the trail, how could one pass up such an opportunity?</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_063625-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>A river running at Crabtree Meadows, the base camp everyone stays at before summiting Whitney.</figcaption></figure><p>The climb to the top was tough. The climb back down was even tougher. 16 mile hikes had become easy for us, but we underestimated Whitney. It was 8 miles practically straight up, and with each step there was just a little less oxygen in the air.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_064052-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>We watched the morning glow on the distant peaks as we hiked up Mount Whitney.</figcaption></figure><p>Every few minutes we would have to break to adjust to the altitude. When we finally made it to the top I was surprised to have phone service, the first of it in nearly a week and the last I'd have of it for over a week to go. I gleefully called my girlfriend, it was a moment of joy after not hearing each other for so long. As I talked I could feel myself getting out of breath purely from speaking, the high altitude affected me more than I even realized.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_064342-500x423.jpg\"><figcaption>Standing at the highest point in the lower 48!</figcaption></figure><p>The view was incredible, we could see the Sierra Nevada stretch out forever. It was a sneak preview for what was to come, yet even the endless snow capped peaks reaching into the heavens and the horizon didn't prepare us for what was coming.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_064835-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Jagged rocky peaks stretched out forever in every direction </figcaption></figure><p>We thought the descent would be easier, after all we would be gaining oxygen. Yet somehow it felt like it took twice as long as the ascent. By the time we reached the bottom we were completely wiped. Unfortunately for us there was little rest to be had. We had 7 more miles go so we could set ourselves up for the first and biggest pass we would be climbing.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_065148-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Hiking down off Whitney. Do you see the lake that looks like a guitar?</figcaption></figure><p> Forrester Pass is the highest point along the PCT, reaching over 13,000 feet. From reports we knew it was covered in snow on both sides, and the best time to tackle those conditions is in the coldness of the morning. If you hit the snow in the afternoon, it will be warm and soft and every step you take you risk sinking down to your waist. So it's better to go when it's still frozen and hard and just wear some traction to keep you from slipping.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_065527-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>On our way over we caught an amazing sunset over the mountains.</figcaption></figure><h2>The First Pass</h2><p>We were up at day break, tired and weary from the long day before, but ready to tackle Forrester Pass regardless. As we ascended to the base of the pass, the forests became thinner and the trees smaller. Rocky summits that dwarfed city skyscrapers began to surrounded us.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_070048-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Climbing out of the forests.</figcaption></figure><p>Eventually the flora gave way entirely for a wide open tundra. Granite, snow, and streams of water stretched out for miles, making their way across the open expanse and climbing to the tops of the surrounding mountains.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_070647-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Isn't it supposed to be June?</figcaption></figure><p>In the distance the trail appeared to walk straight into a vertical cliff. Dennis pointed at it and exclaimed that it was Forester Pass. I was confused, we were looking at a near  90° wall of rock, how could that be the trail? After more pointing and explaining, I was able to make a thin line zigzagging up the cliff. The trail had literally been carved out of the side of this giant wall, and we were going straight up it.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_071113-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Yeah the trail goes through the middle of that...</figcaption></figure><h2>A Wild and Rugged Place</h2><p>The climb was tough, especially after the long day before. It also gave us a chance to finally use the ice axe and micro spikes we had been carrying for days.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_071310-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Don't look down!</figcaption></figure><p>When we finally got to the top and looked out at the other side, our jaws dropped. At our feet was a solid bank of untouched snow that expanded for 1000 feet above us and another 2000 feet below. Where the snow stopped beneath us the ground leveled out into a wide open tundra. In the center was a crystal blue glacial lake, with water clearer than that seen in the Caribbean. As our eyes continued forward we saw as the tundra descended into a valley, with evergreens filling it from side to side for tens of miles. At the edges of the valley rose towering, snow covered mountains, dwarfing all that was below. This, finally, was the High Sierra.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_071641-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Looking out over the backside of Forrester Pass.</figcaption></figure><p>For the next several days we would climb over many of these passes. Our schedules became dictated by them. It was best to hike them in the morning, so the pattern was to hike up early, then make our way to bottom of the next one by nightfall.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_072329-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Ascending over another pass.</figcaption></figure><p>In between the passes we would descend thousands of feet through the tundras and into the lush forests. Evergreens, aspens, and wildflowers would line the trail. Marmots crawled about and deer grazed peacefully on the grasses. We walked by lakes and meadows, and life was abundant everywhere. The views from the top would take my breath away, but the forests warmed my soul.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_072755-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>I'm sure some of my love for the forests come from my New England upbringing and some come from the influence of my girlfriend and her love of trees.</figcaption></figure><p>There was also water. A lot of water. Unlike the desert where we were constantly planning around when we would get our next fill up, water became an after thought in the Sierra. We were never more then 30 minutes from a stream, and it wasn't uncommon that the trail itself would be that stream.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_073255-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Beautiful alpine lakes were also plentiful. They provided water both to drink and to swim in.</figcaption></figure><p>We also had to deal with river crossings. They usually didn't go above the knee, but there were a couple that reached the thigh. Past years had hikers having to swim across to get to the trail on some of the rivers, we thanked our lucky stars for a much tamer year.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_073838-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Carefully crossing a river.</figcaption></figure><p>I can share these pictures of the Sierra to help illustrate what it was like, but the pictures can't show it all. They can't show the sounds of the raging snow melt rivers that constantly drummed in the distance while songbirds sang the vocals. They can't show the smell of pine and wildflowers filling the air or the taste of cold water dipped right out of a glacial lake. They can't show what it felt like to be dwarfed by everything around, to truly feel the scale and  size of the mountains and trees as you walk through, just an observer to this wild and rugged place.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_074202-459x500.jpg\"></figure><h2>Muir Pass</h2><p>The second to last and hardest pass we would go over was Muir Pass. It was named after the famous explorer, John Muir, who is most known for spending much of his life exploring the Sierra Nevada. He called the place \"the Range of Light\", for not only is it sunny most of the year, but the way the light reflects off the many rivers, lakes, snow fields, and granite peaks brings about a brilliant shine everywhere you look.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_074513-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Light reflects off the snow and rocks.</figcaption></figure><p>What made this pass so hard was the snow was not just some scattered sections around the top, but rather snow that lasted for miles in every direction. We hit the ascent early, and it felt like we could have been in the Himalayas. Everywhere we looked there was snow, broken up only by small patches of granite or ice covered lakes. It was a cold and barren place.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_075051-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The wide open expanse heading up Muir Pass.</figcaption></figure><p>Our morning start got us to the top with no issues, but by then the snow was starting to warm and soften. As we made our way down, the postholing that would define the next 4 hours of our life began.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_075309-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The other side of Muir Pass. Snow for miles.</figcaption></figure><p>Postholing is when you take a step on soft snow and instead of supporting you, it gives out and you sink down to your knees, sometimes as deep as your waist. Every step feels like a land mine waiting to go. If you posthole once, you're twice as likely to posthole again trying to climb out of the snow. To make matters worse, many of these weak spots are caused by small ice water streams under the snow. So each time you sink there's a good chance your foot is getting soaked with freezing cold water.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_075457-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>We took a long break to dry our shoes once we were through with the snow. But just minutes after beginning to hike again we had to cross a river...</figcaption></figure><h2>The Other Side</h2><p>After conquering Muir Pass, the trail began to become tamer. We descended into the woods for a long while before making the ascent to the final pass, Selden Pass, we would hit during this stretch.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_080909-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Back into the beautiful green forest.</figcaption></figure><p>Selden Pass proved to be easier than all the others. It was less steep and had very little snow. The views were still stunning, but the intensity level seemed to be dialed back a few notches. The mountains were big, but not the same throne-of-the-gods feeling that was present with the others.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_081259-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Views along the way up to Selden Pass </figcaption></figure><p>We descended down and into forests once more. As we made our way to our campsite, we could see mountains in the distance not capped with granite and snow, but with trees. For the first time in days we could see the sky instead of cliffs as we looked forward. Dennis and I sat and reflected as we watched the sun set over these smaller mountains. While there was still much left of the Sierra Nevada, it felt like we had pushed beyond the part known as the High Sierra.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_081433-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Descending through the forest.</figcaption></figure><p>These past 2 weeks had felt like a month. Everything about it was intense- the uphill, the downhill, the views, the water, the snow, everything. Hiking through and immersing ourselves in this untamed wilderness was truly a once in a lifetime experience. It was hard, very hard, and while we're both ready for some easier terrain, we will always remember our time through the High Sierra.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180616_081837-500x375.jpg\"></figure>"

I'll have to Google it. This recap of your grueling hike in the Sierras, including Mt Whitney, is a very different account from your desert mountain experience.  Noticing your battery life slowly extinguishing must have been very unsettling as you made your way deliberately deeper and deeper into a maze of endless crags! I am glad for you that the rivers were not as challenging as they were last year. I absolutely cannot imagine dealing with the postholing up to the waist! How does one repeatedly bail out of that position with a backpack on?!? I sure hope the bulk of the snow is behind you! Your first pic of the new tent (how is it holding up?) is a cool shot with the mountain peaks, as they all work together visually. Having Dennis surprise you on the road to Kennedy Meadows was fun to read, along with your heartwarming view of the woodlands! And you also surprised us with our pics in there haha...We loved seeing you in May. I can imagine how the trail begins to feel like one's home when that is your daily mission for months and months! Best wishes and loads of love!"

Twelve straight days through the High Sierra had completely depleted our resources and our bodies, we were in need of some downtime.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180627_135044-500x375.jpg\"></figure><h2>Vacation Within a Vacation</h2><p>Vermilion Valley Resort is a small, rustic retreat in the middle of the Sierra Nevada. The nearest town is 3 hours away along a dirt road wide enough for only one car at a time. Between it and the Pacific Crest Trail is the large Edison Lake, and the resort runs a ferry to pick up and drop off hikers.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180627_135444-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Civilization: coming soon. Sort of.</figcaption></figure><p>VVR, as it is frequently called, served as a pivotal stop for Dennis and I. It was the closest thing to civilization we had seen in nearly two weeks.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180627_135647-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Enjoying beer and burgers in the middle of wilderness.</figcaption></figure><p>It proved to be one of the best stops on the trail. The food was delicious, the ferry captain was super friendly, and all around the place was just a great place to relax. We spent half a day of rest there before getting back to the trail. VVR was just a quick break, our real recharge would come a couple days later at the major ski town of Mammoth Lakes.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180627_141940-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>We also gained a new companion to our hiking group. A little monkey sent from my girlfriend!</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately we hit the town during a huge dirt bike event. There were almost no hotels to choose from and the ones that had vacancy had jacked the prices wayyyyyy up. We ended up paying $160 for a two star motel!</p><p>By five o'clock Dennis had passed out sitting upright in a chair in said motel. He remained like that for a couple hours before stirring and making his way to the bed. He laid down sideways, his feet and head hanging off the edges. I later woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, and he was still like that. The adrenaline from the high intensity trek had worn off and we were exhausted. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180627_142348-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Our most scenic camp site yet.</figcaption></figure><h2>Yosemite: A Beautiful Place to Talk on the Phone</h2><p>We spent a couple of days resting up and letting our bodies recover. After filling our bellies with as much food as we could handle, we were ready to get back to the hiking.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180627_143341-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The morning light flows over the Sierra forests and rivers.</figcaption></figure><p>After another handful of days we made our way to Tuolumne Meadows and Highway 120. This was a big deal, as it was the first road to cross the actual trail in nearly 250 miles. We took this opportunity to hitchhike into Yosemite National Park.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180627_142916-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Dramatic views abound.</figcaption></figure><p>Most people go to national parks as a way to connect with nature and get away from technology. While we certainly went to enjoy the views, we also went for the promise of hot showers, freshly cooked meals, and a nice dose of cell phone coverage.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180628_063133-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>After a 2 hour hitch hike, we arrived at Yosemite Valley.</figcaption></figure><p>To our surprise, the scenery in Yosemite was quite different than that of what we had been hiking through. While all part of the Sierra Nevada range, the PCT portion was big on mountainous, jagged peaks. Yosemite on the other hand felt more like a canyon with it's aesthetics having straight walls reaching into the heavens and topped with smooth domes instead of sharp jagged points.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180628_063524-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The best part is there were bridges over all of the rivers, we didn't have to walk through them!</figcaption></figure><p>After our sight seeing side trip, we made our way back to where we had left off. With the High Sierra behind us and all this downtime, we were ready to hit the trail at full throttle. It was only going to get easier from here. Or so we thought.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180628_063825-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Why didn't we just stay and enjoy the tranquility instead of hiking further?</figcaption></figure><h2>Brutal Beauty</h2><p>We didn't know it at the time, but the section between Tuolumne Meadows and South Lake Tahoe, our next real town 8 days ahead of us, was considered by many to be the most physically challenging section of Pacific Crest Trail.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180628_064034-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>It's very faint in the photo, but the the left of this waterfall is a rainbow created by it's spray.</figcaption></figure><p>After the snow covered mountain passes that seemed to go straight up, we naively thought the hardest part was behind us. As we entered the next section, we found terrain that somehow went even more straight up than the previous ones did.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180628_064401-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Soooo steep.</figcaption></figure><p>It wasn't just the ups that were killer. The downs were just as steep and on a few occasions even steeper. I still remember one unrelenting section that left my toes throbbing from miles of downhill on an unforgiving grade.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180628_070211-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Sometimes the trail was not only steep but also a waterfall.</figcaption></figure><p>On top of that, the river crossings became wider and wetter. It was rare that we could cross without getting our feet wet, and even if we did, there would often be miles of mud to trek through following the crossing.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180628_071026-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Beginning the cross.</figcaption></figure><p>Day after day of steep inclines and declines combined with the constant wet feet began to wear on our morale. Some mornings we woke up freezing with the ground covered in frost. Even with all our layers on it wouldn't be until the sun rose over the mountains that we would warm up. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180628_071251-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Frozen frosty trees.</figcaption></figure><p>The worst of it all wasn't the pain of the hiking or the discomfort of the cold. No, it was when we entered mosquito hell.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180628_071455-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>HELP</figcaption></figure><p>When I say there were clouds of them, or that they came by the thousands, I am not exaggerating. We could see in the distance literal gray clouds hovering on the trail. Our choices were walk through the clouds or go off the trail into a swamp. There were times when the swamp walk was preferred.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180628_071817-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Every one of those white dots is a mosquito, and those are just the ones the sunlight is hitting.</figcaption></figure><p>In this hell we would look down at each arm to see seven mosquitoes on each. Another 15 on our legs, a handful more on our chests and faces. These are just the ones we could see. We'd swat them and they'd be replaced in seconds.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180628_072212-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>RUN</figcaption></figure><p>One of the nights I counted the number of mosquitoes sitting on the outside of my tent as I sat safely on the inside. 64 of them, and there were many, many more flying about. Poor Dennis had his zipper on his tent fail just as we entered this section. He got to sleep with the mosquitoes.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180628_072632-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>It looks like a pretty forest, but I was probably running and cursing when I took this.</figcaption></figure><p>For all it's grandeur, the Sierra has been extraordinarily difficult. We are glad for our experiences here, but it is about time we head down from them. The Sierras are beautiful but man are they brutal.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180628_075411-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The morning was the best time to hike, we would have a couple hours before the mosquitoes woke up.</figcaption></figure><h2>Extended Visitor</h2><p>We continued for several days, eventually breaking free of mosquito hell. Our goal was South Lake Tahoe and the glory of All-You-Can-Eat casino buffets.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180628_074425-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>We could finally enjoy the forests without the mosquitoes!</figcaption></figure><p>The terrain, while still steep, began to let up a bit and we were able to make some high mile days. We even stopped part way at an awesome little resort ranch and got some hot food and a bed to sleep on.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180628_074827-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>A ranch resort wouldn't be complete without a handful of horses.</figcaption></figure><p>As we got closer and closer to our destination, we could see the end of the Sierra. The granite peaks made way for more subtle, rolling mountains covered in green. I reflected on the journey so far and the thought that came to me is the idea that being out here, hiking for months on end, brings me to be one with nature. I, and those on similar adventures, are not one with nature. That notion is a myth.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180628_074704-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The smaller mountains we will be heading to were a very inviting sight.</figcaption></figure><p>I walk a man-made trail that I really can't deviate from. I sleep in a tent engineered out of the lightest weight materials. I eat food that has been farmed and processed for maximum hiking convenience. I am not one with nature, I am merely an extended visitor. An observer to all it's beauty and power.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PSX_20180628_095658-500x375.jpg\"></figure>"

It is harsh and unforgiving to humans. However for us to consider being one with nature it is mankind's intelligence that allows us to do what we need to survive in it, so in a sense you are. You have adapted in a way we know and can. But I know what you mean we are inherintly a weak species without our intelligence! Keep at it !"

You look great :) these photographs are so mindblowing-ly gorgeous and your writing suits the beauty in the photos themselves. Your \"one with nature\" revelation resonated with me and I think it holds a lot of weight. Very interesting to think about... perhapsyou can brainstorm ways to become more \"one with nature\" throughout the duration of the second half of your journey on the PCT! It would be fascinating to see what you come up with, as what you're doing right now is as \"one with nature\" as most people think it gets! Love you so much and miss you.

                     "__cdata": "<p>We split an Uber with two other hikers and were deposited in front of a casino hotel. The quiet serenity of the mountains and trees was suddenly replaced with bright lights, billboards, and the sounds of people and construction. Each crosswalk had twice as many people as we would see in an entire day and our filthy clothes and dirt covered faces caused us to stick out rather than blend in.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180711_203425-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Very interesting rock formations in this part of the trail.</figcaption></figure><p>There were all-you-can-eat sushi places, hot tubs, shops, and casinos. We ate and rested and ate some more. We checked out the lake, one of the deepest in the world, and ran our errands. Before we knew it our side trip into South Lake Tahoe was over and it was back to the hiking.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180711_203632-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The lake was so big it felt like it could've been an ocean.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Greener Trail</h2><p>The next 10 or so miles would mark the last terrain that reminisced of the Sierra. The trail weaved through granite and trees as the distant views steadily became greener and greener. We passed Aloha Lake, a rather gray and uninspiring body of water surrounded by nothing but rocks. While still with it's own challenges, the terrain eased up from the high difficulty level present in the last several weeks.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180711_204007-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Cool, but can I have more trees please?</figcaption></figure><p>As the granite faded out, we were rewarded with lush forests. For the first time since we started this hike, we began to have days almost entirely under the canopy of the trees. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180711_204732-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Getting there, but I still want some more trees.</figcaption></figure><p>Some sections would be bright and more open, letting the sun shine all the way down to the forest floor. But then we would walk into a section so dense it would feel like we were suddenly indoors, the massive trees completely blocking the sunlight.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180711_204430-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>There we go!</figcaption></figure><p>Birds chirped and bugs buzzed about. Deer grazed plentifully and leaves whispered together as they rustled under the blow of a slight breeze. It was wonderful and heart warming as the environment truly felt alive.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180711_205023-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>I much prefer swarms of butterflies over mosquitoes.</figcaption></figure><h2>One town, two photos</h2><p>After days of meandering through the forest, we finally reached Sierra City. While the official end of the Sierra section is up for debate, many hikers consider this to be it. South Lake Tahoe marks the end of the Sierra 'map' for PCT hikers, and the geological end of the mountain range wouldn't be for another few days. But the hike into Sierra City, with it's forests and phasing out of the granite, really starts to feel like the next section. More importantly, we descended down below 8000 feet of elevation, never again to reach such heights for the rest of the trip.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180711_205251-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Farewell to the granite on the left, hello to the forests on the right.</figcaption></figure><p>With the hardest part behind us, our morale was up from pain and difficulty that was beating us down in the section prior. That night we stayed in an amazing little hotel in Sierra City. We had our own private deck overlooking mountains and forests filled with not just pine trees, but beautiful oaks, maples, and aspens.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180711_205438-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Dennis enjoys the view from our porch.</figcaption></figure><p>The 'city' was extremely small. So small that I was able to capture nearly the entire place in just two photographs. We had dinner at the one and only place that was open on a Tuesday night. It was taco night, and while the food left something to be desired, the atmosphere provided for a lovely and relaxing evening.</p><p>We ate outside in a small garden, and running through it's center was a natural waterfall surrounded by green plants. There was live music playing in the corner. Dennis wasn't a fan of their song choice and kept complaining that they should play something like American Pie. And by a stroke of fate, they played that very song as their finale. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180711_205638-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Unfortunately I didn't take my phone to dinner so I don't have any photos of the dinner place. But here is literally half of Sierra City.</figcaption></figure><p>After dinner we went for a short walk to check out the small residential section of the town. We passed by some locals drinking on their porch and they offered us a cold beer. We politely declined but got into chatting. As the conversation wandered it's way between talking about the trail and life living out in a place this remote, it eventually reached an unexpected topic-big foot. They began to tell us their stories of the times they had seen Sasquatch. At first we thought they were joking, but the more they elaborated we realized they were dead serious. I'll be keeping me eyes open and I'll let everyone know if I have any sightings.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180711_210104-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>He (or she) could be hiding anywhere in this dense forest.</figcaption></figure><h2>Slithers and pitters</h2><p>Leaving Sierra City was a long, sun-exposed climb. We hiked up and up for hours under the heat of the sun. At one point I saw a baby rattlesnake slither between the rocks on the trail, a definitive sign that we were out of the Sierra Nevada.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180711_210441-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>If you look carefully you can see the trail carved into the side of the mountain.</figcaption></figure><p>For the next several days we cut through lush forests dotted with occasional views of rolling hills barreling into the distance. At a few points we could make out Mount Lassen on the horizon- a volcanic peak we would be hiking by in the coming weeks.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180712_095752-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>There were some interesting rock formations too, due to the general volcanic activity in the region.</figcaption></figure><p>On one day it began to rain, and it was wonderful. Day after day of perfectly blue skies had begun to wear on me. I missed the summer storms of New England and the coolness they provided. It was only a drizzle but it felt refreshing. The sound of the pitter patter on the leaves in the forest was music to my ears.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180712_100302-1-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Yayyy storm clouds!</figcaption></figure><p>Our next stop was in the small town of Belden, population 22. My mom and my sister were flying out and planning on meeting us there for a visit before continuing on a road trip of their own. After miles and miles of hiking we finally reached Belden, and then my jaw dropped in confusion.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180712_100755-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Belden sits at the bottom of the valley between the mountains I'm standing on and the ones I'm looking at. It's a long wayyyyy down.</figcaption></figure><h2>Psychedelic Help - 5¢</h2><p>I had been expecting a quaint little town not unlike the others that we had walked through. A general store, maybe a place to get a hamburger, and a small handful of locals who seem to run everything.</p><p>Instead I walked first into a tent city. And these were not other hikers who were camping out, these were giant tents, the kinds that have multiple rooms with zippered doors to get between them.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180713_061334-375x500.jpg\"><figcaption>Dennis was also perplexed.</figcaption></figure><p>Then I saw the first of what would be many characters I would encounter- a man walking around in his underwear with a giant greenish gray afro. Moments later another guy wearing red polka dot short shorts, a Green Bay Packers Jersey, pink flamingo arm floaties, and the kind of hat you'd see an elderly woman wear while gardening. Another guy walked by in a shirt reading \"This is my human costume, I'm actually a duck.\" A women was placing pieces of paper with rocks on top of them throughout the parking lot. There was a large sign that read \"How F----- up are you?\" with a series of jokes that I did not understand. I could hear the muffled sounds of dance music somewhere in the distance.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180713_061454-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Aren't we all?</figcaption></figure><p>As I walked through this unexpected place, I was on the phone with my girlfriend. I was describing what I was seeing and she said it sounded like I could've been making everything up. All the while the constant sound of electronic music boomed from somewhere in the trees.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180713_061618-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>This appeared to be their refrigeration unit.</figcaption></figure><p>Upon further investigation we found out we were at an event literally called \"Camp Fu#* it up.\" I tried googling it to see if I could learn more, but there seemed to be nothing about it. If anyone else can tell me what it is, please do so.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180713_061753-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>At least they censored their flags. There could be kids around!</figcaption></figure><p>We followed the music into the trees to find a DJ booth on a beach by the river. Dozens of people partied about in an unending assortment of outfits. A sign read \"psychedelic help - 5¢.\" The most prominent part of it all though was the man made island in the middle of the river.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180713_062114-375x500.jpg\"><figcaption>I've lost my dignity. Can you help me find it? No? Okay.</figcaption></figure><p>There was what appeared to be part of a playground floating in the river, with people climbing all over it. Surrounding it was a bunch of blow up rafts, in the shapes of ducks, flamingos, and more. Other partygoers were carrying coolers full of drinks out into the lake for their islander counterparts.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180713_061915-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Where am I??</figcaption></figure><h2>Homecoming (to me)</h2><p>My mom and my sister met up with us here. They were just as shocked and confused as Dennis and I were as to what was going on. A women came up to Dennis and told him she was going to be right back with a bag of champagne for him. That was our cue to leave. We got in the rental car and headed to the Airbnb my mom had rented out. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180713_062239-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>It was a fantastic little Airbnb!</figcaption></figure><p>Seeing my family gave me a sudden clarity into the mental exhaustion that had become commonplace while thru hiking. I realized I was not my normal self only through the the contrast with people whom I was close to and whom had not been on the trail.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180713_062539-500x374.jpg\"><figcaption>Dennis was also not feeling himself.</figcaption></figure><p>It took well into the next day to start to feel like myself again. It was great getting to see my family and spend some quality time catching up and hanging out. We cooked fresh meals together which was a major treat. Dennis and I had been eating nothing but rehydrated camp food and restaurant meals for months.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180713_062432-477x500.jpg\"><figcaption>Hey guys!</figcaption></figure><p>The visit was short but sweet. My mom and my sister dropped us back off in Belden before heading out to go see the sights of California themselves. Being a couple days later, \"Camp Fu#* it up\" seemed to have dispersed and Belden had transformed into the quaint town I had expected. Well, except for the guy with a raccoon tail who tried to sell shrooms to Dennis.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180713_062715-1-500x378.jpg\"><figcaption>\"Warning: You are leaving Belden Town at your own risk. Good luck out there!\"</figcaption></figure>"

                     "__cdata": "<p>The climb out of Belden was steep and hot, a precursor for what was to come. Across the valley we could see lush pine forests providing shade and shelter for the creatures and visitors that passed below. But where we were was a burn zone. The charred gray remains of trees stood amongst small chaparral bushes, reminding us of the shade that was once there and taunting us as we instead were subjected to the blistering heat of the mid afternoon sun.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180723_204241-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Maybe if I just crawl under that bush I can cool off.</figcaption></figure><h2>Halfway There</h2><p>After hours of pushing through the inclined frying pan we finally ascended past the burn zone. For the next couple of days we put on the miles under the protection of the forest until lo and behold- the Pacific Crest Trail halfway point!</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180724_200832-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>No more hiding in bushes!</figcaption></figure><p>It was a momentous occasion, or at least it was supposed to be. Halfway done with this crazy journey, yet it just felt like another stop on the trail. Another trail register to sign before I would be on my way to the next point.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180723_205009-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Glass half empty or glass half full?</figcaption></figure><p>As I looked through the pages of the register my apathy wasn't replaced with excitement, but rather a twinge of sadness started to creep into me. Most of the entries were signed with people's trail names- nickames given to each other by those met and befriended on the trail. I didn't have a trail name. I hadn't made any friends on the trail. The hiking community that had been talked up so much on the forums online was not something I felt apart of. I felt alone and a bit insecure. At the end of the register I signed my name, my real name, \"Kyle S. - Acton, MA\" and I closed the book and continued hiking.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180723_205441-500x432.jpg\"><figcaption>Will you be my friend? No? Okay bye.</figcaption></figure><p>A couple hours later I caught back up with Dennis. We took a break and had some banter and laughs. He commented on how the amount of other hikers we've run into really seems to have dwindled down. \"And most of them seem to be hiking alone\" he added, \"and I would be too if we weren't hiking together.\"</p><p>After that talk I felt a lot better. I did have a friend I was hiking with, and a community as well, even if it only consisted of two people. As I continued on that day the feeling of being on a thru hike really started to hit. Up until that point it had felt more like an extended backpacking trip. It took hiking halfway and over 1300 miles to finally feel like the long distance adventure that it is. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180723_210155-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>For those of you who know Dennis you know how hard it is to get a picture of him smiling. This might be the first one I've ever seen. He refused to look at it after I stealthily captured it.</figcaption></figure><h2>Feel the Burn</h2><p>We made our way to Lassen National Park as we circled the base of a volcano. Along the way we got to see a thermal geyser that spewed steam 100 feet into the air. A small stream flowed out of the bottom of it, steaming and boiling it's way down the mountainside. At another point was a lake literally named Boiling Lake. The water bubbled and churned and the gurgling and hissing could be heard even at a distance.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180724_201651-375x500.jpg\"><figcaption>This cloud is doing it wrong.</figcaption></figure><p>The wonders of the volcano wasn't the only thing coming in hot. We pushed a 33 mile day through the park, our biggest record yet. Along the way we spent several hours in another exposed burn zone. Charred tree corpses created a creepy hallway as they ghastly swayed in the wind. The lifeless and leafless trunks provided no reprieve from hours of afternoon sun as we hiked mile after mile.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180724_202130-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Views of the volcano, Mount Lassen, can be seen through the burned forest. Cool, but I would've preferred the trees and the shade.</figcaption></figure><p>At nearly eight o'clock I finally reached Old Station where Dennis was waiting. My body was beaten, my feet sore and numb, and I had run out of water a couple hours before. Unfortunately the promised town turned out to be quite the disappointment. There was one store, and it was closed. I filled up my water bottles from a garden hose in the back and chugged several liters until I could think straight. That night we set up our tents and went to sleep in some grass behind the post office.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180724_202450-497x500.jpg\"><figcaption>When \"resort\" appears to have been added as an afterthought and is written in sharpie on a piece of cardboard, one must really lower their standards. Like all the way to the ground. And then sleep on that ground. </figcaption></figure><h2>Blackout</h2><p>The next day we had to wait until 11 for the post office to open. While initially frustrating, we did need the rest so the down time ended up being appreciated. We attempted to hitchhike to a breakfast place a few miles down the road while we waited. For an hour and a half we put our thumbs out as car after car flew by until we eventually gave up.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180724_203225-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>A riveting place to spend 9 hours.</figcaption></figure><p>At 9am the one store in our immediate vicinity finally opened up. They sold some hot food and a small assortment of junk food. As I perused about, I noticed another hiker standing in line. He seemed to be stretching, but in a really odd way. It was almost as if he was leaning back to the point of falling over. A moment later my brain correctly processed what was happening, and to my realization he was in fact falling over. His head hit the edge of a shelf before his body collapsed limply on the floor.</p><p>In the next instance every bit of information from my 2 day Wilderness First Aid training came flooding into my mind all at once. I reached for my phone as I tried to pick out the parts I needed from the confusing jumble of procedures that swirled inside of my head, the difficulty only enhanced by the stress of a real first aid situation arising. </p><p>As I grabbed my pockets I remembered I had left my phone plugged in and charging in another room. I shouted for someone to call 911 as I ran to the downed hiker. In nearly 80% of the exercises I had done in the First Aid training we had to assume a possible brain or spine injury. The reason being is that a simple fall from an upright standing position is enough to cause one. I understood in that moment the importance of that emphasis. Through the jumbled thoughts I knew the first thing I needed to do was to stabilize the patients head to protect it in case of damage. All this happened in a matter of seconds.</p><p>As the hiker came to I explained to him what happened and that it was best for him to stay lying down until the paramedics came who would have the experience and tools to properly assess any injuries. I began to go down the list of the questions I was taught to ask, going in the order that I remembered them as opposed to the order they were supposed to go in. After a few minutes a cook from the store came out of the back and told me he was an EMT. He took over from there until the ambulances arrived.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180724_203600-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>A bit bigger and better equipped then the ATVs in the other shot.</figcaption></figure><p>The hiker was thankfully fine. He had had a pressure point in his shoulder that when he went to stretch it he blacked out. The fall did not cause a concussion and the paramedics left without any additional medical assistance needed. The hiker went back out onto the trail later that day. </p><h2>Feel the Burn</h2><p>That afternoon we packed back up and continued onward. Along the way we stopped to check out an old lava flow cave. We walked a quarter mile underground from one entrance to another. We could see where the lava had dripped and hardened on the ceiling. The best part, though, was that it felt like we were in an air conditioned building. If only the rest of the trail could've felt like that.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180724_203919-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Some of these climbs would be way easier if we could just go through the mountain.</figcaption></figure><p>As we marched on, we witnessed one of the most spectacular sunsets yet. Huge dramatic clouds filtered reds and oranges onto the open landscape. At one point I came across a doe and her two babies. We made eye contact as volcanic mountains and glistening clouds towered behind them. I followed the deer family off trail for a few minutes where I watched them gallop across an open field and into the sunset.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180724_204920-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The sky looked like it was something that existed only in expensive movie special effects.</figcaption></figure><p>We awoke the next morning to the rumble of distant thunder. A sunrise as spectacular as the sunset greeted us from behind the distant rain clouds. We were hiking over a section know as Hat Creek Rim and it had a reputation for being hot, dry and exposed. The overhead clouds blocked the morning sun, giving us a false sense of cool temperatures. We would soon learn why Hat Creek Rim had gained such notoriety amongst PCT hikers.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180724_205310-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Clouds make everything look more epic.</figcaption></figure><p>By late morning the clouds dissipated leaving the hot sun directly overhead. The trail was not without trees, but they tended to be off on the edges. It almost felt like the trail was intentionally designed to avoid any and all shade.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180724_205609-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Couldn't they have made the trail just 15 feet more to the right?</figcaption></figure><p>Hours went by and I passed other hikers sprawled in the dirt under the few trees they could find. I myself occasionally did the same, the hot sun wearing me down physically and mentally. As the hours neared our final destination for the day, I found myself running out of water. I was rationing a few ounces of water and scourging through my snacks to find anything with a hint of moisture.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180724_210017-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>We stayed at a ranch right off the trail that night and I saw a mountain lion. </figcaption></figure><p>The next day was no better. We made it 10 miles where we stopped at the small Burney Falls state park. Tired, sore and wiped out we decided to wait out the heat of the day and hike some more miles that night. We cooked up some hot dogs from the park store and fell asleep under some trees.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180724_210416-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Burney Falls because Hillary got the nomination.</figcaption></figure><p>The pain was real. Every night I went to sleep my legs would throb and I could feel them pulsating. My feet had been numb for several weeks, something hikers called \"Christmas Toe\". A pinched nerve would cause numbness in one's toes and feet and it would clear by the time Christmas came around. The heat would drain me, just being in the sun for a few minutes would be enough to warrant taking a break. And Dennis was having just as much, if not worse pains. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180724_210628-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Post hot dog nap.</figcaption></figure><p>If it only took three months to hike from Mexico to Canada that would be alright with me. Three months would be enough to experience the newness and excitement. To transition into a routine and hiking as a lifestyle. And then for the shininess to wear off and feel the challenges of pushing through the pain and over the finish line. But instead that last section continues for an extra 2 months.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180724_212545-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Monkey doesn't have any pain because he gets to ride on my backpack all day. Also because he's a stuffed animal and stuffed animals can't feel pain. That's scientifically proven, Google it if you don't believe me. </figcaption></figure><p>Don't get me wrong, I have still been able to find enjoyment out of each and every day. It's just that the fun-to-pain meter had finally notched a bit over to the pain size. Quitting was not an option though. Canada was waiting and we were over halfway done. The only way to end the trip was to make it all the way through, one mile at a time. So we got back on the trail and kept on hiking. This is the challenge we signed up for after all.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180725_170613-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Enjoying this sunset was particularly challenging.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Key Ingredient</h2><p>We made our way into the next town, Castella, only to find it's amenities at the same bare bones level as Old Station. There was a gas station store and an RV park and that was it. My socks had holes in them, my toes were still numb and I needed new insoles, the fabric of my shirt had worn so thin you could see my skin through it. All that on top of needing some rest, showers, and a hot meal. This \"town\" just wasn't going to do.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180726_084605-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Perhaps you want to be friends?</figcaption></figure><p>There was a local trail angel that was able to give us a ride into the nearby town of Mount Shasta. There we were able to gorge ourselves on burgers, Thai food, and avocado filled breakfast burritos. It was fantastic. I needed the break too. While doing my errands I felt like I could've fallen asleep walking around the stores. I dozed off on the floor of our motel room while packing my food later that evening before eventually climbing into bed.</p><p>The next goal was a week away, and it was a big one. Seiad Valley, while it's amenities were on par with the other towns (it also has a CAFE, so slightly better), it would be the last stop in California. After over three months of hiking through this giant state it was very exciting to be finally reaching the end of it and moving on to Oregon.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180726_084953-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The Castle Crags were a cool sight climbing out of Castella. I had hoped to meet the king and queen but they weren't there.</figcaption></figure><p>The terrain over that week did not give us any breaks. If we wanted to leave California we were going to have earn it. We spent day after day hiking through exposed burn sections. The steepness was comparable to what we had in the High Sierra, only this time it was 95° and humid. Every morning we would wake up ready to tackle the day, but by 3 o'clock moral had dropped to the ground. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180726_085939-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>A sad tree graveyard. </figcaption></figure><p>About halfway through Dennis and I had to come to a decision to temporarily break up the band. In a couple of weeks I was going to get to spend a few days with my girlfriend who was flying out to see me. A side trip I was very excited about, also one Dennis obviously would not be joining me on. </p><p>Before we started this hike, we were unsure how long we would hike together. But we turned out to be great hiking partners, and at this point we had done over 1500 miles together. We had experienced the jaw dropping views and magnificent sunrises together. And we had pushed through all of the pain and hard parts together. We were determined to finish this trail together.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180726_090718-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Views like this.</figcaption></figure><p>For the second time on this trip we said goodbye. He hitched into a nearby town, looking for some needed rest and to make up for the time I would be taking off with my girlfriend. After that I was hiking alone for the first time since we split while I went home back in the desert. It was sad, but we will back hiking together in a couple of weeks, and at that point it will be the endgame.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180726_093413-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>All alone.</figcaption></figure><p>I've come to realize why it took so long for this trip to feel like a thru hike vs just an extended backpacking trip. The missing ingredient was pain, both physical and mental. A backpacking trip is an outdoor vacation. It's all fun, pushing your body and seeing some amazing sights. But a thru hike is a challenge, a life experience. Once the shine wears off, the pain and emotions start to set in. It's in that fight to push through that pain and keep going all the way to the end that makes this an adventure of a lifetime and not just an extended vacation.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180726_094128-500x375.jpg\"></figure>"

Great pic of Dennis smiling as that is an extreme rarity and nice selfie of yourself which also seems to be rare in your blog! I loved the deer pictures too the second one had a look that reminded me of Snickers. Your philosophy in the end about how experiencing pain makes the adventure that much more remarkable is so true and resonating. One can not enjoy the good in life without also enduring the bad. It must really make you appreciate all aspects of life! Either way, the people who you love and love you are the most important thing and you have plenty of those! Hope you had a great time with Jessie this weekend! Love and miss you Kerd"

Your wonderful family members say it so well! Impressive literary expression is but one gift that clearly  runs in your family, along with genuinely loving hearts! I agree with all they have said in response and am totally awestruck by your writings and photos! Phenomenal!. And, I hear your loneliness. You tug at my heartstrings asking the deer to be your friends! Indeed you are so loved and by many and are being embraced and held in the hearts and thoughts of family and friends including me! I know you know this but “This too shall pass” has gotten me through the hardest times. Maybe I have said this in earlier responses. Welp, it Has been A good mantra for me.  Hoping you have a terrific time with beautiful Jessie, and Ha, Love that grin pic of Dennis! I wonder what the story behind it was...  CONGRATULATIONS on now being more than halfway AND being in OREGON now!!!! WOW!!!  You ARE  DOING IT!!  ☺️❤️"

It was a rollercoaster of emotions for me as I laughed and teared up the whole way through your blog! I look forward to reading it again! Congratulations on making it over halfway on the PCT!!! WOOOHOOOO!!!!!!!  It was thought provoking to read how you realized for yourself what it means to be a thru-hiker. (BTW, backpacking had never felt like an \"extended vacation\" for me, but more like a microcosm of a thru-hike...just sayin' :&gt;/     !!!)  The highway pic of \"Being Alone\" was PERFECT in the context of your story. Also, the \"Views Like This\" shot is AMAZING.....along with the sunset you were \"Challenged to Enjoy\" and your opening shot of Dennis walking on the trail. Cool that you included the smiling and resting pics of your hiking buddy, Dennis. And.... the little stuffed monkey from Jessie looks happy all the time....I like to think of the monkey as the quiet vessel attached to your pack that is witnessing and secretly storing all of the blessings and gems you've acquired along the trail, despite your human pains! Thank you so much for writing this and for sharing your humor, your pain, your reflections and amazing photography for all of us who follow you in our hearts! Love you SO MUCH and miss you!!!!!! Keep up the footwork, the stamina and enjoy that moment in a few days when you take that step over the state line into Oregon. Almost 4 months it's been! Amazing!!!!! Love you!!! Take care!!!!!"

I am saddened to read of your loneliness, but know that too is only natural as you push yourself through those deserted landscapes, physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. Having Dennis with you is a blessing for sure ... So many people love you and are cheering you on from a distance!

Even though none of them were within a dangerous distance of the trail, the sky was completely filled with smoke.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180811_061233-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The mountains are playing hide and seek.</figcaption></figure><p>The views were nearly gone as the haze of smoke filled the entire region with a thick white fog. I felt it in my lungs and in my stomach, as if in a constant state of breathing in second hand smoke. Between this, the exposure through the burn zones, and the steep elevation, I was really missing having Dennis to complain with at the end of the day. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180811_061514-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>When I got high enough to be above the smoke, the mountains looked like islands.</figcaption></figure><h2>Border Crossing</h2><p>As the countdown to the Oregon border became closer and closer, the charred landscapes started to turn green again. Shade from the trees provided a much sought after relief from the sun. Even more than that was the morale boost brought on by the life of the forest.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180811_064648-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>A tree sanctuary!</figcaption></figure><p>I finally found myself approaching the long awaited border, a line drawn by men hundreds of years ago that was otherwise meaningless to the whims of nature yet held so much significance to those who embark on this hike. Unlike the midpoint which left me apathetic on arrival, this border felt like an accomplishment.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180811_064840-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Monkey made the extra effort and climbed the tree too.</figcaption></figure><p>After 102 days, I had hiked the entire length of the state of California. Entering into Oregon also signified nearing the end. It would only take a handful of weeks to finish this state and be on to Washington, which truly would be the final stretch. It was a little sad to be enjoying this moment alone though. I had been hiking with Dennis since the Mexican border, it felt weird not to be celebrating together as we crossed this milestone. I would be meeting back up with him soon though, so the celebrations would have to wait.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180811_065119-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>For now I'll just be alone in these magical forests.</figcaption></figure><h2>Time to Sit</h2><p>A few days into Oregon I made it into the city of Ashland. It was an oasis I had been looking forward to, I hadn't taken a day off since my family had visited over a month earlier. On top of that, almost all of the \"towns\" since then had maybe one restaurant to choose from, if I was lucky.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180811_065454-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Do not set off small, uncontrollable explosives in a region filled with highly flammable tinder. I think that's a reasonable request.</figcaption></figure><p>My body was more than ready for the break. I rented an AirBnb I spent my time eating and watching Netflix on my phone in sweet, sweet air conditioning. I did make my way into town for a few hours where I ate more and went to a movie by myself. It was awesome. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180811_065733-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Look at all that shade!!</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately the air of Ashland was just as thickly filled with smoke as the trail was. People on the streets walked around with masks on to protect their breathing. I talked to several locals who commented on how in all the time they've lived there, this has only become a recent phenomenon. I was only a visitor to this, but to them a summer of smoke had become the standard.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180811_065848-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>There are some mountains out there somewhere...</figcaption></figure><h2>Irreversible</h2><p>Not long after getting back on the trail I found myself once again hiking in burn zones. The smoke had thickened to a fog that not only hide all views, but even obscured the charred trees just a couple hundred feet away from me. I felt like I was hiking through a ghost town.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180811_192138-500x375.jpg\"></figure><p>One night I camped in one of these burn zones. The ground was brown and barren, devoid of any vegetation. The sun burned red though the smoke, feeling like sunset hours before it was supposed to. Everything was silent except for the creeking of dead branches and a ghastly wallow as the wind funneled through the desolate environment. I was sleeping in a graveyard. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180811_192312-346x500.jpg\"><figcaption>This was what the campsite looked like on the app I use to navigate.</figcaption></figure><p>Forest fires are part of a healthy ecosystem. Or rather they were. Long periods of drought followed by an increase in severe lightning storms is causing damage faster than the forests can keep up. I was walking through the effects of climate change and it depressed me. These beautiful forests are being destroyed more and more, and at the rate we are going at the Pacific Crest Trail will look very different in a few generations.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180811_192445-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>This is what the campsite looks like now.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just nature that's at stake here. Talking with the locals and hearing the news of the fires spreading across the west coast, there are communities and lives at stake. Towns are burning down, citizens are spending every summer breathing in smoke, people are dying.</p><p>This isn't some hoax perpetuated by the Chinese, this is a real crisis that is already affecting us. So much irreversible damage has already been done, and more is inevitable. But we can stop this. Everyone has to do their part now, because if we keep waiting there won't be much of a planet left to keep fighting over.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180811_192846-375x500.jpg\"><figcaption>Before every sunset on the west coast looks like this. And this wasn't sunset when I took this picture.</figcaption></figure><h2>Better Together</h2><p>For me there was a light shining through the smoke, and that was a visit from my girlfriend, Jessie. She was meeting me at Crater Lake National Park, just a few days from Ashland. I hadn't seen her in over 2 months and I was so excited to get to spend some time with her.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180811_193252-375x500.jpg\"><figcaption>Here's a literal light shining through the smoke.</figcaption></figure><p>As I got closer and closer to the park she was sending me texts with updates on her flight status. New England was having severe thunderstorms, causing major delays in takeoffs. She ended up missing her connection, having to sleep on a bench in the San Francisco airport, and catch a flight to Oregon in the morning.</p><p>Despite the flight issues, it ended up being the smoothest trip we had been on together. Previously we had a trip to Puerto Rico cancelled due to a hurricane; a trip to New Hampshire where I pulled my hamstring days before and it was too cold out to even use the hot tub; and then a ski trip in Colorado where we got into a car accident on day 1 and spent the rest of the trip recovering. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180811_201908-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Leave it to the couple who loves the woods to find the densest, lushest forest in the middle of a city.</figcaption></figure><p>After a delayed but gleeful reunion we drove up to Portland for the weekend. We had a wonderful time, sightseeing through Oregon's forests, wandering the trendy streets of the city, and eating some amazing food. It was a short but wonderful trip. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180811_193713-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>So happy together!</figcaption></figure><h2>Smokey Crater</h2><p>Jessie dropped me back off at Crater Lake. After a tearful goodbye she was off on her way back to Boston and I was back on my way towards Canada. Part of me wished I could go back home with her, but I have to finish. The end was coming closer and closer.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180811_202110-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>I'll see you in a little over a month honey!</figcaption></figure><p>A few miles into hiking I met back up with Dennis. Other than a brief day of feeling sick, he was doing well. He had taken some rest while I was with Jessie, and his body was thanking him for it. It was good to see him again and I was glad to have a hiking partner again.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180812_060714-500x270.jpg\"><figcaption>Making my way around Crater Lake, this time with Dennis. Compare the smoke to the picture with Jessie.</figcaption></figure><p>The hike made it's way around Crater Lake, providing what should have been spectacular views. Instead the dense smoke of the region continued to fill the air as the day went on. When Jessie had dropped me off it was hazy, a few hours later the lake was completely gone. We couldn't even see the ground at the bottom of the cliffs we were standing on.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180812_060915-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Can you still see the lake?</figcaption></figure><h2>Acceleration</h2><p>The further north we pushed, the more the smoke decreased a bit. The views were still faint, but after a few days we could at least see the mountains right in front of us again.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180812_061807-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The pointiest peak I've ever seen.</figcaption></figure><p>We started hitting record mile days- 32, 34, 35 miles a day. The terrain was easier than what we had been on, and our bodies were adapted to thru hiking at this point. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180812_135133-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Also some epic camping sites.</figcaption></figure><p>Our pace needed to stay fast now. We were on track to finish mid September, and there was a strong drive too keep us to that schedule. Around then is when the Washington rain switch is flipped. It'll be sunny all summer long, but once that switch flips it won't stop raining. While rain is what happens in the valleys, in the mountains that rain becomes snow. We did not want to be hiking in snow. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180812_142559-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>I had my fun with the snow in the Sierra, I'd like the mountains to stay like this now.</figcaption></figure><p>The weather wasn't the only motivation to go faster. I wanted more time with my girlfriend and to see my family again. I wanted to be able to give my body the rest it needed and to take regular showers again. I even missed the little things, like being able to pour milk out of a carton instead of rehydrating it with pond water.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180812_142933-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>1900 down, a measly 750 to go!</figcaption></figure>"

You capture intricate, whimsical compositions of burnt trees which take on a new life of fine and bold lines that play with smokey light. The conical glow in your \"magical forest\" forest appears to be a tangible shield of sorts , which I found to be mesmerizing. But it is not an isolated event because many of your photos send me into a trance!  On another note, major congrats on getting into Oregon! What a journey into the landscape of the mind as you focus your attention on the daily, relentless land forms you encounter. We are so excited and amazed at what you and Dennis have accomplished thus far and wish you continued success along your winding path. It was great to know that you and Dennis would be hiking together again! So happy that you and Jessie enjoyed a smooth vacation together! Whew, right! ?!?!? May The Force be with you :)  and stay strong.... XOXOXO"

Most mornings we would be hiking around 6:30AM, and we would go until 8, sometimes even 9 at night. It took over 100 days to hike through California and we were determined to do Oregon in just around twenty. Although our mindset was that we were near the end, we still had over 700 miles and a month of continuous hiking to go. We had to just keep taking it one day at a time, the rest we needed we would come soon enough. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180823_114514-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>This sign looks as beaten as we feel.</figcaption></figure><h2>Mountains and Magic</h2><p>The smoke finally cleared up right as we were reaching a section marked with lush forests interspersed with beautiful ponds. With the haze of the smoke gone it brought about a crispness to the woods that had me feeling rejuvenated.

As I looked upwards I saw a massive volcano towering above me, making me feel like a small and insignificant speck. For the next couple of hours the trail would meander between forests and volcanoes, lush life and dramatic views. All the while I was listening to my Pensive PCT playlist, a playlist my girlfriend made for me with songs that accentuate emotions and wonder. As the music flowed and the sun set through trees and behind mountains, I felt the magic of northern Oregon.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180823_115226-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>One of the Three Sisters.

The first because it was so cold the condensation from my breath froze the inside of my tent, the next because of strong winds blowing sand through my tent and onto my face all night, and then because a family of deer decided the bush 6 inches from tent was the tastiest of all and spent the entire night chomping and stomping about.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180823_161312-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>We also hiked for several miles in exposed lava fields. A hard section but very cool. </figcaption></figure><p>After all that we finally reached our next \"resort\" only to find the staff was on a two day retreat, their only one of the entire summer, and no food was being served or sold. But even through all the difficulty, the beauty in between always made the slog worth it, even if we were cursing the skies in our moments of pain. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180823_161706-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>This beautiful view was earned by hiking through one of the worst burn zones we've been in followed by a calf-deep river crossing in which a dead horse was rotting a little ways downstream. But these meadows were worth it all.</figcaption></figure><h2>All hike and no play makes Kyle a dull boy</h2><p>We made our way to our next destination, one that I had been looking forward to since the start of the trip. After a day of hiking through the woods, the trees suddenly cleared out revealing dramatic views of Mount Hood, the volcano we had spent the day climbing without even knowing it. Right on the mountain sat the historic Timberline Lodge, the place I had been interested in for quite some time. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180823_165209-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>It literally felt like climbing a steep sand dune for a mile and a half.</figcaption></figure><p>The lodge was one of the inspirations for <em>The Shining</em>, and the exterior of the building had been used as the outside of the hotel in the film. <em>The Shining</em>'s influence on me was during my time as a Graphic Design undergrad. I had been tasked with creating a poster and an opening title sequence for a movie, and Stephen King's big screen horror film was the one I chose.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180823_164638-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Buhm buhm buhmmmm.</figcaption></figure><p>That project ended up being a turning point for me. It was the first time that the skills I had been learning really came together to create a body of work that I am still proud of today. It was the first time where I really started to feel a passion for the field of graphic design. Those skills and passions would later propel me to success with my senior project, <em>Reconnect</em>. Years later that senior project would evolve into the very blog you are reading right now, <em>Reconnect.life</em>.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180823_205508-324x500.jpg\"><figcaption>The poster way back from Junior year.</figcaption></figure><p>It feels very meta to be writing about visiting the Timberline Lodge on this blog- a lodge that inspired a film that influenced my early design passion that drove me to create a project that would evolve into this very blog on which I would be writing about a huge journey that would take me to that very lodge. Also, the food was fantastic, all you can eat breakfast for $18.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180817_064017-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Evening thunder storms around Mount Hood felt very appropriate for the location of a horror film hotel.</figcaption></figure><h2>Uncertain End</h2><p>The weather turned brisk and cool, and it felt like the fall as we hiked the last days in Oregon. The weather was reminiscent of a New England autumn. The slight chilliness on the outside brought me warmth on the inside as it triggered feelings of nostalgia for home.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180823_165538-375x500.jpg\"><figcaption>Plus some sweet waterfalls in what was described as a 'jungle like' section.</figcaption></figure><p>Dennis's niece, Kelsey, and her boyfriend, Mike, met us at the last town of Oregon. They live near Portland and wanted to meet up with us along this journey. After catching up in the town of Cascade Locks, they drove us back to their apartment where we would take what may have been our last day off for the rest of the trip.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180823_165817-375x500.jpg\"><figcaption>Amazing views through the forest as we made our descent out of Oregon.</figcaption></figure><p>As we spent our time split between checking out Portland and lying on the couch, my excitement for the end was not where it should have been. A series of forest fires had sprung up in Northern Washington and Southern Canada, forcing the Forest Service to close the northern section of the Pacific Crest Trail as well as all other trails in the area. After months of planning followed by months of hiking, after pushing my body to it's limits every single day, after all the money spent on gear and expenses, after putting my relationship on hold, saying goodbye to family, quitting my job, I had just learned that I might not even be able to reach the end. It felt like a punch to the stomach.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180823_170043-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>And sadness that with the rate of these fires the whole trail could look like this one day.</figcaption></figure><h2>Bridge of the Gods</h2><p>After a nice and relaxing visit, Kelsey dropped us back off at Cascade Locks. We got together the food we would need for the next section and began our way towards The Bridge of the Gods.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180823_172135-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The name comes from a Native American legend. It is believed the original Bridge of the Gods was a land bridge that eventually eroded away.</figcaption></figure><p>The name is fittingly epic, as it stretches over the Colombia River connecting the state of Oregon to Washington. Right in the center stand signs noting which state you are entering, depending on the direction you are traveling. This massive bridge is the portal in which PCT hikers make their first steps into the final state of their journey.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180823_193757-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Someone on the PCT app commented about doing the Washless Washington Challenge. Hike all of Washington without showering or doing laundry. I will be staying as far away from that hiker as possible.</figcaption></figure><p>I made those steps with a feeling of both excitement and sadness. I was ready for the end, the drive to complete this challenge is what kept me motivated in the hard parts and what enhanced my excitement throughout the good times. But as much as I was looking forward to the completion of this journey and everything that came with that, it saddened me that this huge, once in a lifetime trip was coming to an end. I was in the process of realizing a life long dream and pretty soon it would just be a memory.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180823_205011-375x500.jpg\"><figcaption>Soon I would once again spend my days following tail lights instead of trail signs.</figcaption></figure><p>The prospect that I might not be able to reach the official end only added to my mixed emotions. Finishing on some random highway did not have the same climatic appeal as a huge monument sitting on the Canadian border. As I made my way across the bridge the views were obstructed by thick smoke, a continuous reminder of the fires wrecking havock throughout the state.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180823_201709-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>It would only get smokier over the next couple days.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Journey</h2><p>Making my way into the forests of Washington helped me feel a little bit better. They were absolutely beautiful and healthy. Some sections were so green there was moss covering every bit of brown bark and gray rocks. I felt like I was on a safari through a jungle. It was some of the lushest forests I had ever been in. With the smoke obscuring the views above, I couldn't have asked for a better section to spend several days hiking through.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180825_084435-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The Monkey on my pack was in his natural habitat.</figcaption></figure><p>The next few nights would have us competing for tent sites. \"Trail Days\" had just ended at Cascade Locks - a huge, multiday PCT festival that many hikers congregate too, some even straight up skipping sections to make it for the parties. Dennis and I had been able to avoid the event as neither of us had any interest in the festivities scene, but now the aftermath was hitting us. Dozens of hikers who wouldn't have normally been at the same point as us now flooded the trail. Every day and every night was filled with so many more people. We hoped as time went on the bubble would  disperse and we could get back to the more solitary experience. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180825_085622-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The only ones I want to interact with are Dennis, Monkey, and this dog that I found.</figcaption></figure><p>We finally closed in on our first town in Washington - Trout Lake. The morning of hiking into town we woke up to a thick, cold fog. It was wonderful, the cold front had eliminated the smoke and the air was chilly and refreshing. Still no views, but I would take fog over smoke any day.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180825_090221-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>It made for some really cool and eerie woods.</figcaption></figure><p>Once in Trout Lake, the fog cleared up enough to give us views of the huge Mount Adams that loomed over the town. It was a spectacular sight to be held and complimented a nice and relaxing evening hanging out in hot tubs and eating until our stomachs burst.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180825_090816-500x376.jpg\"><figcaption>The cows are on a farm instead of roaming the trail for once!</figcaption></figure><p>While within WiFi range, we were able to learn the latest on the fires closing the end of the trail. The bad news was the fire hadn't gotten any smaller and the trail was still closed. The good news was there was an alternate that could at least get us to the Canadian border. We were still several weeks away so our hope was still there that we could finish on the official trail, but if all else failed we could at least complete our trek from Mexico to Canada.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180825_094815-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Canada was just over 400 miles away now.</figcaption></figure><p>The next day we got on trail with weather even colder and cloudier than the day before. I spent most of the day hiking with my down jacket on, and it was honestly wonderful. Hiking through steep, hot, sun exposed burn zones filled with smoke had been draining my morale and this chilliness was exactly the weather I needed to boost my spirits.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180825_092420-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Nice and warm with my puffy and my non removable face warmer.</figcaption></figure><p>We spent the day meandering through beautiful northern subalpine forests over some of the most gradual terrain we've had in awhile. The clouds semicleared for a few hours to give us some amazing and dramatic views of the volcano we had been circling before closing back up as we reentered the forests. We got to our campsite earlier than usual and my legs weren't throbbing like usual.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180825_191628-375x500.jpg\"><figcaption>It felt like a mix of New Hampshire and the Sierra Nevada.</figcaption></figure><p>It had been one of the nicest days on the trail in awhile and had me really enjoying the hiking again. A day like that was exactly what I needed as it helped me feel better about the uncertain end we were fast approaching. This trip had never been about the destination, reaching the border will just be another moment. The experiences had in the five and a half month journey leading up to that moment are what this trip is about. Whether we end at the official monument or another spot on the border or just some random highway, its the stuff that happened leading up to that point that will have made the memories and influenced my character. I am still hoping for a proper end, but it's days like this that help remind me why I am out here in the first place. There is truth in the saying that the journey is more important than the destination.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180825_084907-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>I may complain from time to time but it has been an amazing journey so far.</figcaption></figure>"

                        "__cdata": "\"Wonder and Woe\", another fitting title for this part of your trip. Congrats on being within 400 miles of the finish line! Your \"dog friend\" looks more like a cross between a fox and a wolf. There have been such a variety of switchbacks between fog and smoke filled skies, expansive views vs socked in trails, solitary days vs unexpected folks on the trail. And those 3 sleepless nights in a row! Wonder and Woe...very much so! So good that you got to see Kelsey and Mike along the way, too!  I wonder if you have had your \"puffy\" for much of the trip once you were out of the desert of CA. Will these be your last pair of boots until the end of the PCT? I love how you caught them in the pic at the 2200 mile mark...dirty ankles and uneven shoestrings.  And finally, I think it is so cool what you explained about the \"meta\" and the origins of your Reconnect.life blog. It is pretty amazing that you encountered the Timberline Lodge, the subject of your graphic design project back in school and the meaning it holds for you as you make this trip and have created this blog! You ended by saying you \"may complain from time to time\", but I cannot imagine how you have not complained more!  It is so amazing what you guys are doing...and you have been so faithful to walking the whole thing every step of the way!  I hope the fires come to an end with the rain and that you guys remain safe on your trails, wherever they may be. Peace and LOVE!!! Thank you for this wonderful post, Kyle!!! Following tail lights instead of trail signs is probably likely, but that journey will have its rewards, hopefully in some unforeseen and meaningful ways. Plus you can hike New England again! Love you!!!!"

                     "__cdata": "<p>I vividly remember my first moments on trail like they were yesterday. Dennis, his dad, and I sat in the back seat. Dennis's brother Tom sat in the passenger seat and Tom's partner Ken was driving. His car looked brand new, fresh from a wash. It wouldn't stay that way as we turned onto the dusty dirt roads that lead to the Mexican border. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180831_081245-500x243.jpg\"><figcaption>The journey that would take us to the start of the journey.</figcaption></figure><p>We passed a sign for Lake Morena, the place we would be hiking to the next day, and a place I had only read about up until then. As we got closer and closer we saw the trail itself where it crossed the road. We would be there in another hour. It was my first time seeing the PCT and I was filled with excitement, nervousness, and wonder.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180831_081654-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>The good old days back before the trail became incredibly steep.</figcaption></figure><p>We reached the monument, the southern terminus of the PCT. It stood atop a hill like a beacon. Ken parked the car and we all made the walk to the top. I called my girlfriend. I called my mom. We took pictures. Tears, laughter, hugs. Dennis's family shuffled back into the car and drove off. The excitement was over and we stood there silently with only the wind to keep us company now. We walked over to the wall that separated us from Mexico and put our fingers through a hole, a PCT tradition so we could say we had \"been to Mexico\", and with that we started our trek.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180831_082006-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Mexico, within walking distance of Canada.</figcaption></figure><p>That was five months ago and we've been hiking ever since. I remember the excitement when we hit our first 500 miles, and now we have last than that left. We've begun the countdown, 417 miles to go.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180831_094939-375x500.jpg\"><figcaption>I remember standing at the Southern Terminus so vividly yet it feels so long ago.</figcaption></figure><h2>Goats in the Clouds</h2><p>When I first got news that the end of the PCT was closed due to fires it felt like a gut punch. Then I crossed the Bridge of the Gods and the air was filled with the worst smoke we had had the entire trip. It left me feeling depressed, that after all that we weren't going to be able to hike to the official end, and everything in between would be smokey and obscured. But I was wrong, Washington so far had been incredible. The scenery and sense of adventure had not disappointed as we made our way through the final leg of the trek.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180831_095417-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Some of the views are arguably cooler with clouds.</figcaption></figure><p>We awoke to another chilly and cloudy day. It was the perfect hiking weather as we trekked through the beautiful Washington forests. The dense clouds had replaced the smoke, if I wasn't going to get my views then it's a swap I would take any day. But we hoped it would clear for us as we were in the Goat Rocks Wilderness, considered to be one of the most scenic sections of the trail.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180831_095808-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>No longer the endless sunshine of California. </figcaption></figure><p>As luck would have it the clouds cleared right as we reached the alpine zone. Mountains that had been hiding in the fog began to appear all around us. It was so cool. Awestruck we kept climbing.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180831_100717-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>That wasn't there before.</figcaption></figure><p>But then we came over the saddle of the ridge and peered out to the world on the otherside. The views leading up to that point were beautiful, but this took our breath away. Towering thousands of feet above us was a massive, spikey range of multicolored mountains. Below was a huge valley filled with green that went on forever. It was a view so intense, and one that we hadn't seen anything like since the Sierra.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180831_101120-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Monkey needed a picture in front of the mountains.</figcaption></figure><p>We enjoyed hiking through these dramatic peaks for a few hours before the clouds moved back in and covered them up. That evening we hiked up into the clouds and setup our tents in a cold, rainy fog. 376 miles to go.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180831_101804-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Here comes the clouds again.</figcaption></figure><h2>Slip and Slide</h2><p>The next morning Dennis was on the trail before I had even started making my breakfast. Everything outside was cold and wet, and for Dennis his tent had offered little protection. Everything he had was completely soaked, it was a good thing we would be in a town that afternoon.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180831_102057-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>I don't want to go outside </figcaption></figure><p>While the previous day had been a day of scenery, this one ended up as the day of adventure. The fog from the night before had only thickened, leaving but 20 feet of visibility. We hiked over glaciers where one could only tell the ground from the sky due to the dirt that had accumulated on the snow.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180831_102305-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>White out!</figcaption></figure><p>We made our way over the Knife's Edge, a section narrow with steep drop offs like the edge of a knife. It was cold but exciting. As we descended further down the mountain the fun began to change to misery.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180831_102440-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Other hikers or GHOSTS?!</figcaption></figure><p>Due to a fire in the area we took a detour on some other trails so as to keep a safe distance away. These trails were not the nicely graded PCT that we were used too and instead subjected us to a roller coaster of steep ups and downs that went on for miles.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180831_102639-500x487.jpg\"><figcaption>Good thing they laminated the map.</figcaption></figure><p>As we dropped in elevation we eventually got out of the clouds. But that meant we instead got cold rain and fog. For hours we slogged on. My fingers were so cold and wet I was unable to use my phone as the screen didn't recognize the touch. Yet at the same time my body was drenched with sweat from the steep uphill climbs while wearing layers of rain gear.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180831_102814-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Cold, wet, steep AND a burn zone. What more fun could we ask for?</figcaption></figure><p>All this fun ended with a three mile road walk on a terrifying highway. Cars flew by at 50mph while we hiked as close to the edge as possible. Finally we made it to 'town' where there was an inn and a gas station with a store. We got a room and dried ourselves and our gear. 357 miles to go.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180831_103042-500x378.jpg\"><figcaption>There were tons of cars and tents, and the hotel was nearly booked. All of this was not hikers but rather National Guard and Firefighters who were dealing with the nearby fire.</figcaption></figure><h2>Emotional Cocktail</h2><p>Over the next couple of days we would hike through incredible scenery and wildlife. I saw a small elk family walk across a meadow, marmots chase each other through the rocks, and pikas squeak and scurry about with branches of blueberries in held tightly their mouths.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180831_103415-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>This was the meadow, unfortunately the elk walked faster than I could pull out my phone.</figcaption></figure><p>I would be blown away by my first view of Mount Rainier. I had seen some incredible sights on this trip but the shear size of this mountain caused me to make an audible 'woah' when I first saw it. The top of it was in the clouds, but the base was so massive I could only imagine how high it must be. Then I realized I didn't have to, the top was actually <em>above</em> the clouds, towering even higher than what I had envisioned in my head. I wasn't ready to end this trip. Only 302 miles left of these experiences.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180831_103710-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>It almost looks like part of the sky.</figcaption></figure><p>But then we would wake up in the morning in a cold fog. Things inside the tent would be damp from the night. Motivating myself to get out of my warm, dry sleeping bag and put on cold, wet, sticky, stinky clothes became a chore every morning. Every night my legs would throb so much it was hard to fall asleep. Previously the pain would be gone by sunrise, but now the throbbing would last well after I woke up.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180831_104002-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Still beautiful, just with a little bit of realism sprinkled in.</figcaption></figure><p>One of the days I thought I might've had a fever. I had nausea all day, fatigue beyond the usual, chills, and a loss of appetite. I still had to push myself through 28 miles of hiking, there is no calling out sick on the PCT. Another morning I woke up to the realization that I had set up my tent a foot away from a human turd. I had come in after dark the night before and by some miracle had avoided stepping on it or setting up my tent in it. I am ready to be home again, only 261 miles to go.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PSX_20180831_104245-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Here's a dramatic evening sky to get that last image out of your head.</figcaption></figure><h2>Never a Dull Moment</h2><p>We made it into the next town, Snoqualmie Pass. In addition to some nice rest, we also had some good old internet access where we learned a bit of good news. Thanks to the cold and wet weather we had been having, the northern fires had shrunk in size. This meant the end of the trail was open again! I was ecstatic, the sadness I had about not getting an official finish was gone. We were going to be able to end at the true terminus. </p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180903_062729-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Hard to burn when there's literally a cloud of moisture filing the land.</figcaption></figure><p>The next morning continued to be cold and rainy. After a slow start we were all packed up and ready to go before we made what Dennis called a \"record breaking u-turn\". As soon as we stepped foot outside and felt the weather we decided to go back to the inn and get another night of rest instead.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180903_063120-500x375.jpg\" /><figcaption>It makes sense why it often feels like we're in a rainforest.</figcaption></figure><p>Boy were we glad we waited. The scenery turned out to be absolutely breathtaking. Had we hiked out the day before we would've been in a fog and missed this whole section.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180903_063432-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Dennis takes it all in as we cross the Kendell Katwalk.</figcaption></figure><p>Instead we walked through some clouds, under others, and above the rest. With huge, jagged peaks, the mountains were as dramatic as that of the Sierra. Yet the forests were thicker, lusher, and greener. The scenery of that day was perhaps the best of the trip thus far.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180903_192222-375x500.jpg\"><figcaption>Mountains and valleys and clouds, oh my.</figcaption></figure><p>My blissful wandering was interrupted by the loud buzz of a nearby helicopter. It skirted out of the clouds above me and I watched it start making loops in the area. A few minutes later I turned a corner and saw a couple hikers waving in the air. It was a search and rescue.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180903_190535-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>I heard the helicopter well before I saw it as it was hidden amongst the clouds.</figcaption></figure><p>Their friend had fallen 75 feet of off the edge of a cliff after losing balance while going to sit down. He had been down there for 3 hours while awaiting search and rescue. Possible broken ankle and possible shoulder injury, but otherwise okay. I joined in with the other hikers to wave down the helicopter and point to where the injured member was.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180903_190929-500x410.jpg\"><figcaption>The helicopter comes in closer.</figcaption></figure><p>I was amazed by the precision of the helicopter pilot and the efficiency of the team doing the extraction. The pilot kept the massive vehicle hovering as close as possible, nestled right between several trees, a foot in either direction would've lead to a collision. Then the team dropped down and the whole operation was done in 15 minutes.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180903_191042-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>It's amazing how much wind is generated by a helicopter. It makes the situation feel ten times more intense.</figcaption></figure><p>The helicopter passed and the excitement died down. We were back to the quiet serenity of nature. 234 miles to go.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180903_191807-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Seven fingered Jack.</figcaption></figure><h2>Yin and Yang</h2><p>For the next couple of days we hiked through scenery that felt like the best hits album of the PCT. Rolling hills and giant, jagged peaks. Pristine alpine lakes and lush forests. Piercing blue skies alternating with huge dramatic clouds.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180903_213633-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>And epic campsites.</figcaption></figure><p>For those same couple of days we were subject to all the hardest parts of the trail rolled into one. Killer climbs followed by knee breaking downhills. Hot, exposed sections followed by freezing cold nights. Burn zones, rain, river crossings.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180903_213918-500x375.jpg\"><figcaption>Cold, wet fogs while sweating profusely on steep uphill climbs was always a favorite pastime.</figcaption></figure><p>Washington was all the parts that I would miss the most on the trail. It was also all the parts I was most ready to be done with. Each step forward now felt like a very tangible step towards the finish line. It has been an incredible journey, one that I am sad to see end but am very ready to reach the conclusion of. When my next update comes out, this trek will be over. 188 miles to go.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180903_192118-500x375.jpg\"></figure>"

Especially loved the \"human turd\" story and then the lovely trail/landscape photo to help clear our minds! HAHAHA!! PERFECT!!! So glad I got my chores done before reading this cause i'm gonna read it again now! My goodness but your photos are INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL!!! I know the landscape is, but you really are capturing it for us with such SKILL! Thank-you! Ok, gonna share this one of course! So great talking to you and Dennis after your \"world's fastest U turn\". Dennis's \"two nights off the trail\" giggles cracked us all up! Big hugs to you both!! Happy trail!"

As I view the map for my trip out there next week, I feel overwhelmed by the vast wilderness of which you are a part and through which I must driveto find you. The thought of being surrounded by nothing but trees for hours of driving is daunting. And then I once again remind myself of how you guys have been walking amongst mostly nameless and then some famous mountains for 5 months!  There is no comparison between the bird's eye view (my perspective while on the computer looking at your path and the geography of the land)  and being there as you are, entrenched in every aspect of the experience - which you describe so well.  Your blog has brought your adventure into our warm homes and I have appreciated every update. I cannot wait to see you guys next week! As in July, when Emilia and I visited you in the mountains of CA, I lookforward to driving past the mountains in which you have walked and imagining your experience with AWE from the comforts of my rental car! Carry on in these last days with safety in mind and a well deserved feeling of unbelievable accomplishment!!!!!!"

The air is cold and still, I lie in my sleeping bag dreading the thought of putting on my pants and shoes that are still saturated from the storm the night before. I'm not sure where Dennis is, we were separated by the rain and sleet that had pounded us. I assume he is camping ahead of me and did not see my tent set up slightly off of the trail. Canada is only 11 miles away, I'll be done with the entire hike before lunch. I hope I am able to catch up with him so we can hike the last few miles together. For the first time in over 5 months, I do some push-ups to get my body temperature up before putting on my wet, cold clothes and begin hiking the end.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_122748-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning.</figcaption></figure><h2>Two Weeks Earlier</h2><p>Skykomish was going to be one of the last towns we would stop in to resupply. I had a package sent by my girlfriend waiting for me at the post office. Or so I thought. After back and forths with the post lady and text messages, my girlfriend eventually found the tracking number for the box. It turned out the box had left Boston, made its way to New Hampshire, then to Boston again, back to New Hampshire, over to Boston, into Western Mass, then back to Boston again, New Hampshire, Boston, New Hampshire, and finally... into Boston again where it still sat over a week after she had sent it.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_123235-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>Almost the entire town of Skykomish.</figcaption></figure><p>This left me with the fun task of resupplying from a gas station, the one store in the whole town of Skykomish. I bought a box of Special K cereal from them which I later found had been taped shut and the bag inside had been partially ripped open. Thankfully Dennis had some extra food to share with me as we made our way through a section we would dub \"The Gauntlet.\"</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_123622-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>Bring on The Gauntlet!</figcaption></figure><h2>The Gauntlet</h2><p>It was three straight days of 25 miles. Unlike doing long days in Oregon, hitting this kind of mileage in Northern Washington was far more strenuous. None of the terrain was flat or ideal for cruising along, it was steep and unrelenting whether we were going up or down.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_124034-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>Follow the yellow brick road.</figcaption></figure><p>The difficulty of the climbs was enough to leave us exhausted, but the challenge didn't end there. For these three days the trail felt like it could've been abandoned. Blown over trees had us scrambling about, overgrown bushes left our legs and arms scratched up, and broken bridges made crossings rivers just that much more exciting. At one point the trail was so bad I ended up following a path off of the trail that had been created purely from endless hikers getting lost in the same way.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_124513-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>Well it's better than nothing.</figcaption></figure><p>But with all this pain came great rewards. The views of the not-so-distant mountains were absolutely incredible. We made our way through the Glacier Peak wilderness, and I would put the views there as some of the most breathtaking on what has been an endlessly breathtaking trip.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_125244-375x500.jpg\"/><figcaption>When I say breathtaking I mean that both figuratively and literally. Those climbs and high altitudes are hard!</figcaption></figure><p>Some of those overgrown bushes I was complaining about gave us some amazing treats as well. Wild blueberries, huckleberries, thimble berries and salmon berries lined the trail for miles and miles every day. Dennis and I couldn't stop eating them they were so delicious and sweet. An all you can eat berry feast.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_125722-468x500.jpg\"/><figcaption>Huckleberry Hands.</figcaption></figure><p>I haven't even gotten to how incredible the woods were. It felt like we were in an enchanted forest as the light peered through the branches and illuminated moss covered old growth trees. The deeper we hiked into the Glacier Peak wilderness the more and more ancient the forest became.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_125938-375x500.jpg\"/><figcaption>Welcome to Narnia.</figcaption></figure><p>At one point we reached a grove of trees that was alive when man discovered gun powder and created the first form of paper money. Trees as old as 600-1000 years old made up the bulk of this stretch of the forest. We hiked slow, I felt so serene as I walked among these ancient and peaceful behemoths.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_130502-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>It was hard to truly capture the enormity of these trees with my camera.</figcaption></figure><h2>Wilderness Communities</h2><p>The Gauntlet was over as we made our way into Holden Village. Not normally part of the PCT, this Christian camp became a stop of ours due to having to take an alternate route around a fire burning on the trail. The town was given to the Lutheran church as a donation from a mining company. It was quite the experience, they had an ice cream parlor, a barber shop, a bowling alley, and more, all with designs reminiscent of the 60's. What made this particularly unique is this village could only be accessed by foot or by ferry.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_130758-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>The valley down to the village.</figcaption></figure><p>We filled our bellies, washed up, and made our way to Stehekin - considered by many to be the last stop on the PCT before Canada. After a grueling day that rose to an honorary addition to The Gauntlet we were rewarded with a ride on the back of an ATV/golf cart hybrid with a cold beer in hand thanks to the kind folks who picked us up.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_131012-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>Seems safe.</figcaption></figure><p>Just like Holden Village, Stehekin could only be accessed by foot, boat, or float plane. It really felt like a wilderness community with scenery reminiscent of the great wilds of Alaska. Our stay was brief, the next day we received our last resupply boxes of the PCT and began our way to Rainy Pass where we would be meeting my Mom for a final day off.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_131158-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>There is absolutely nothing ominous about that sky.</figcaption></figure><h2>Full Circle</h2><p>Rainy Pass lived up to its name. As we made our way to the highway crossing it began to drizzle before eventually turning into a light rain. We knew we had a warm hotel room to stay in that night so the weather was of little consequence. But little did we know that this was the point at which the switch had flipped - our days of dry skies was about to end.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_132052-500x379.jpg\"/><figcaption>My favorite trail sign of the whole trip.</figcaption></figure><p>It was a wonderful last day off with Mom. We reminisced about the journey so far, rested up, and relaxed on the back porch of a Northern Washington Ranch. Being on the west of the mountains, the climate was drier and nostalgia of the beginning of the hike began to kick in. For part of the day we toured the town of Winthrop, even further west then where we were staying. The area was a straight up desert filled with chaparral bushes and sandy hills. It felt like a fitting final stop, to be able to see the stark contrast of the dry, arid scenery of the beginning as we approached the cold, damp end.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_132416-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>Too bad we can't bottle sunshine for later.</figcaption></figure><p>My Mom joined us for a mile and a half of hiking when she dropped us off. It was a nice memory made, despite the fact that it began to heavily rain on us as we made our way forward. We had a quick goodbye, it was too cold and wet to have a long farewell. Dennis and I headed up the trail and my mom turned around to walk the road back to the car. Only 65 miles left to Canada.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180912_140302-ANIMATION.gif\"/><figcaption>Before the rain started and it was still hard to get Dennis to smile.</figcaption></figure><h2>Inclement Beauty</h2><p>As the days to the end dwindled down I became more and more reflective of the journey that we had been through. The novelty and newness of the desert. The intensity and excitement of the Sierra. The difficulty and trials of Northern California. The beautiful forests and incredible volcanoes of Oregon. The grandiose finale of Washington. Every section had its ups and downs, both literally and figuratively. And I was feeling sad to see it all end.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_133630-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>The leaves of the bushes were all turning red, saying ready or not winter is coming. </figcaption></figure><p>But intermittent snow and rain kept pulling me back into reality. We were really out there in the great northern wilderness. It was cold and wet, there were no signs of civilization, no cell service, just us and the dispassionate wild. This was not a place for humans to be, yet there we were. It was beautiful and also terrifying. Incredible views left me wanting more, frigid nights left me wanting to be done as fast as possible.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180924_114850-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>Views like this come at the cost of frozen fingers.</figcaption></figure><p>On our very last night of the Pacific Crest Trail we would receive the worst weather of the entire trip. For most of the day we got lucky - cloudy skies but the rain held off. We were making speed, we knew the forecast was for more rain and any ground we could cover while it was dry would be miles we wouldn't have to hike in the rain.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_134030-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>No need to rain on our parade!</figcaption></figure><p>About an hour and a half before we reached our potential camp site for the night a light rain began to seep out of the sky before eventually growing to a steady moderate rain. The weather itself began to soak our gear, but what really became a problem was the overgrowth all around us. Bushes had reached into the trail and with each step we had to unavoidably push through them. Water that had accumulated on the leaves poured down our pants and into our shoes with every stride. I could feel the water squishing around my feet, as if I had just submerged them in a lake. My pants were so wet they clung to my skin.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_134311-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>Bad clouds!</figcaption></figure><p>As we continued to hike up the mountain pass and gain elevation the weather only got colder. What was a 50° rain became a 40° rain. The forest coverage lessened and the winds picked up, the only thing providing any warmth was hiking. This was no warm summer shower, it was hypothermia conditions.</p><p>I got to the potential campsite before Dennis did. Up there on the mountain ridge the winds whipped and the rain was mixed with sleet. There was a small cluster of trees that I was able to find some shelter in while I waited. The sites were not the best -  they were flat but on the ridge it would leave the tents exposed to the elements. However looking at the map it was unlikely anything better was going to come up for miles and we needed to get out of this weather. For about 20 minutes I waited in my small cluster of trees for Dennis so we could decide our plan. But after 20 minutes I needed to make a decision ASAP.</p><p>Because I hadn't been hiking my body temperature was now dropping. I left my small tree shelter and went into the wind swept and sleeting ridge. The most important thing for me to do was get my tent up, change out of my wet clothes, and get inside my sleeping bag. I needed to get warm.</p><p>My fingers were numb and the cold left me extremely irritable. I hammered in my tent stakes trying to keep the inside as dry as possible. With every thing that went wrong I found myself cursing audibly and loudly. I eventually propped up my tent and crawled inside. Changing my clothes with the deceased dexterity of my frozen hands proved to be as hard as setting the tent up. I eventually made my way inside of my sleeping bag and warmed up as the sleet and wind wailed on the outside of my tent.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_134557-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>Cold but safe.</figcaption></figure><h2>Counting Down</h2><p>That last night I never saw Dennis. My tent was slightly off trail, it could be seen if he looked back after passing by, but otherwise he would likely not see me. I assumed he was ahead of me as there had been no spots to camp between where I was and where I last saw him. I hoped he would figure out that he had passed me and not hike all the way into Canada wondering where I was. It was sad to spend that last night alone. We had hiked pretty much the entire trail together, and on this final night of this incredible journey we were not together.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_134931-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>Monkey watches while I pack up my wet, semi frozen tent.</figcaption></figure><p>After watching my last sunrise on the PCT, I finished up my morning routines and put on my sopping wet clothes. They hadn't dried overnight, in fact they were slightly frozen. I had hoped too sleep in a bit on this last morning, but I had to catch up to Dennis. All packed up and ready to go for one last time.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_135149-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>Snow dots the trail from the night before.</figcaption></figure><p>Thankfully Dennis had figured out I was behind him and was taking it slow that morning. We caught up with just 6 miles left to Canada. It felt surreal as we walked these final miles. Before we knew it there was only 5. Then 4. 3. 2. 1.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_135434-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>The scenery remained incredible right to the end.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Monument</h2><p>It was hard to come to a realization that this was it. In 20 minutes we would be done, no more hiking day after day after day. We could hear cheers in the distance of hikers a little ahead of us who were reaching the monument. These sounds of celebration helped cement the fact that this was really it.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_135708-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>The mountains in the distance? Those are in Canada.</figcaption></figure><p>The next signal of the end was a view of the clear cut that marks the US/Canada border. It was as clear as a line on a map, distinctly showing which side was the United States and which side was our neighbors to the north. Then about a quarter mile before reaching the monument we got a glimpse of it through the trees. It felt like seeing a unicorn, this mythical structure that we had been seeking for over 5 months.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_135923-500x417.jpg\"/><figcaption>If you look for the little notch on the top of the ridge you'll find the clear cut.</figcaption></figure><p>Minutes later we reached the monument ourselves. The big finale. The end of the amazing journey. It was crowded with about a dozen other hikers. Some of them I recognized but none of them I knew. I felt like I had walked in on someone else's party. Dennis and I had to wait our turn to take pictures. The commotion felt chaotic and made us uncomfortable. As soon as our pictures were taken Dennis continued on into Canada to setup camp. I lingered for a few more minutes to send some satellite messages to my girlfriend and my family.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_140807-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>Not the experience of solitude I was used to.</figcaption></figure><p>It wasn't until I left the monument and made my first steps, alone, into Canada that I felt excitement for what I had just accomplished. I felt relieved to be done with this huge trip, no more endless days of pushing my body to exhaustion. But I also felt a pensive nostalgia as I remembered all the incredible parts of the journey.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_140954-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>I have a new appreciation for something being \"within walking distance.\"</figcaption></figure><p>I got to the camp, Dennis was already setting up his tent. My dad would be meeting us there that evening with some celebratory bourbon and then hiking out with us to the road the next morning. The two of us hung out and reminisced for awhile until some light rain pushed us into our tents.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_141232-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>We were done, but with one last night in the woods.</figcaption></figure><p>Dennis said he felt the end was anti-climatic. I got what he meant. We spent 5 long months hiking over 2652 miles through deserts, mountains, and forests. The journey was dramatic and at times overwhelming. But the end was just a whisper. A period at the end of a long sentence.</p><p>I was now in Canada yet the meaninglessness of a border was even more reinforced. Nothing was different. The Earth doesn't care what people say is theirs. It all belongs to nature. I felt the same way as I feel on my birthday. When people ask \"What's it like to be one year older?\" the answer is it feels no different.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_141558-428x500.jpg\"/></figure><h2>Transitioning Back</h2><p>After a few hours of waiting around my dad finally arrived. It didn't feel like we were meeting up though, but rather like I was having a visitor. The woods had become my home, and my dad was coming over to see my new digs. At the same time his arrival helped to stabilize my realization of the end. My dad helped provide a grounding back to my life as I began my adjustment back to the real world.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_141906-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>Hey dad!</figcaption></figure><p>In my interactions with my dad I could see the contrast of where my journey had taken me. He was the one who first introduced hiking and backpacking to me. All of my outdoor techniques and habits had been adapted from him. But after nearly 6 months in the woods many of those had evolved and changed, and I could now see where they had all started.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_142254-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>On my first ever backpacking trip with my dad and two of my friends in Highschool, we brought Smoked Sprats for lunch. There was an extra can we didn't eat and it has sat in my pantry ever since. I thought this would be a fitting time to crack them open.</figcaption></figure><p>We made our way down to Route 3 in Canada and from there my dad drove Dennis and I to Seattle. It felt surreal to be done and it was hard to come to grips with what we had just accomplished. My dad kept trying to tell us how immense of a feat we had done, but it didn't really register.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_142813-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>Not quite the same backdrop.</figcaption></figure><p>That night in Seattle we took a ride up to the Space Needle for sunset. From the top we could see Mount Rainier and the entire length of the Washington Cascade Mountains. As I gazed out at the horizon I thought to myself \"I hiked everything I can see out there and more\" and for the first time I felt the scale of what I had completed. A guy walked by me and and passively said \"Epic isn't it?\" I simply responded \"Yeah\".</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_143157-500x375.jpg\"/></figure><h2>Beauty in the Pain</h2><p>In the wee hours of the morning Dennis woke up to catch his flight down to San Diego. He packed his things and our goodbye was a few quick whispers followed by a fist bump while my dad slept. A big adventure together with a farewell that lasted less then a minute. It really felt over now. It was hard to fall back asleep.</p><p>I spent the next day walking through Seattle with my dad. Everything felt more intense. My senses seemed heightened, I noticed the people, the cars, the wind through the trees, everything so much more. I felt more relaxed and in the moment. There was no pressure to go, go, go.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_143610-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>The hustle of the city is quite the difference from the quiet of the forest, yet I felt at peace in both.</figcaption></figure><p>One week later and it already feels like a distant memory. I feel integrated into normal life again, my feet are feeling better, the dirt and tan lines are fading. It's almost as if it didn't happen at all.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_143819-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>On my flight back I watched as we passed over many of the landmarks I had spent days hiking around.</figcaption></figure><p>I am already feeling nostalgic of the trail. Its beauty and its adventure. But I am forgetting all the pain. While I was hiking I was missing parts of life back at home but blocked out the hard parts there too. Whether embarking on a huge adventure or working a desk job, every part of life has its pains and its beauty. The Pacific Crest Trail was a once in a lifetime journey, but really every moment only happens once in a lifetime. If there was one takeaway from this trip it is to savor the present and to always try and find the beauty in the pain.</p><figure> <img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PSX_20180925_144119-500x375.jpg\"/><figcaption>I may be done with the Pacific Crest Trail, but it will always be a part of me now no matter where I am.</figcaption></figure>"

I loved plotting your progress on the map and getting a sense of where you were and seeing the significant distances you hiked each day.  You and Dennis conquered heat, drought, distance, elevation, cold, and most significantly had the mental will to go forward and complete the entire PCT, every step. It was very special for me to meet up with you and Dennis on your last night on the trail. To have the opportunity to experience the excitement at the monument which marked the end of the PCT.  It was was truly exciting and humbling.When I arrived at your campsite and you crawled out of your tent in the cold wet weather, you looked a little dazed. But I don't think that was the case. Rather you were in the rhythm of your hike and I was the outsider who just arrived. I kept thinking of the famous phrase, “Dr Livingstone I presume?” I felt so lucky to see you in the incredible world you lived in for the last five months knowing what an accomplishment it truly was!"

                     "__cdata": "<p>  The Patagonia region is home to numerous national parks throughout both Chile and Argentia. At 150 thousand guests each year, the most visited of them all is Torres del Paine. Compare that number to the 500k average yearly visitors at Peru’s Machu Picchu or California’s Yosemite National Park with nearly 5 million people/year, and even on the busiest trails in Torres del Paine you will still find space to contemplate the quiet beauty of nature.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/torres-del-paine-vertical-375x500.png\" /><figcaption>Torres del Paine translates to “Blue Towers”, which comes from the huge, blue glacier lakes that surround the area as well as the famous rock pillars (above) that look like towers jutting up from the rocks below.</figcaption></figure><p>  In February of 2020, my friend Dan and I took a week-long backpacking trip along the “W” traverse of the park. There are two main routes that visitors hike - the “W” trek, which is about 46 miles long, and the “O” circuit, which is about 68 miles. Both routes cover the same quintessential view points, however the “O” adds an extension around the backside of the park that makes the trip into a loop instead of a traverse.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/05-EXP-CHILE-TDP-W-CIRCUIT-MAPTHUMB2-500x500.jpg\" /><figcaption>Both the W and the O are named after the shape of the trails themselves. As you can see, the O includes the W in it. <a href=\"https://www.experiencechile.org/torres-del-paine-w-trek-programs/\" target=\"_blank\">Map from ExperienceChile</a></figcaption></figure><p>  If you have the time, the “O” really looks like it would be an incredible addition to the hike. In our planning, we had hoped to be able to complete the full loop, but due to the unfortunate reality of limited vacation time we only had a week including travel for this adventure. Thus we chose the “W” and took on the trail with absolutely no regrets.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200217_101016-500x375.jpg\"/></figure><h2>Getting There</h2><p>  Making our way from the northeastern United States all the way to what is just about the southernmost point in the world outside of Antarctica was an adventure of its own. Part of our choice in choosing Torres del Paine was that it has some of the best infrastructure for getting in and out of the park compared to other areas in the Patagonia region.</p><p>  Our itinerary for getting there was a flight from Boston to New York followed by an 8 hour layover, and then an overnight flight from New York into Santiago, Chile. From there we would have 2 hours to get through customs, recheck our luggage, and then take another 4 hour flight to Punta Arenas. At that point, we would get on a bus for 3 more hours to Puerto Natales, the closest town to the park. The following morning we would then get up at 5:30 am to get on another bus that would finally get us into the park at 9:30 am.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200216_065601-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  Of course a plan as intricate as that was bound to fail somewhere along the way. It turned out that our connecting flight from Santiago to Punta Arenas was completely incorrect from the one that was sold to us. As in the gates closed before we were even off the first flight! Thankfully, we were able to get on board another one that day, and were also able to get on a later bus ride to Puerto Natales. The biggest impact the mishap had on our trip was that almost all of the grocery stores were closed by the time we got into the town. We had to hobble together whatever camping food we could find which led to an unfortunate week of eating mostly unsalted beans and rice!</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200217_074645-500x375.jpg\" /><figcaption>The bus rides themselves were a beautiful part of the trip in their own right.</figcaption></figure><h2>Day 1: The Base of Las Torres</h2><p>  After 3 hours on the bus (and 2 days of travel leading up to that point), we finally reached Torres del Paine National Park. We had the option of taking the bus for another 30 minutes to reach the start of the “W”, or we could walk the 4 mile trail that paralleled the dirt road. Anxious to get hiking, we opted to walk the distance without a moment of hesitation.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200217_092230-500x375.jpg\" /><figcaption>The bus dropoff point. Las Torres rises up in the distance.</figcaption></figure><p>  Having our feet on the dirt after so much sitting was exhilarating. We walked through open, yellow grasslands as “Las Torres” (The Towers) loomed in the distance. Clouds danced between them and we only hoped it would stay clear enough to see them by the time we reached the base. The entire week pretty much called for rain, but that was part of the adventure of Patagonia. Few people go there without half their time spent in inclement weather.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/0217200828_HDR-500x281.jpg\" /></figure><p>  Four miles in and we finally reached the “start” of the park. Had we taken the bus in, this would have been where it dropped us off. There was a small store selling highly priced snacks and alcohol. Something we took note of for later. We pitched our tents in a windy field, finding the few spots left that had some semblance of tree cover. The nights in Patagonia could see gusts of up to 60 mph. Hoping our tents were secured enough for the day, we packed a few snacks and some water and headed off on our main hike of the day - a 10 mile out-and-back to the base of Las Torres.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200217_110418-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  The trail followed a steady but manageable incline as it rose up from the grasslands and into the mountains. It wasn’t long before we entered some beautiful forests - valleys of green built by the natural flow of precipitation captured by the mountains. Back and forth we meandered through trees and open ridgelines, constantly being surprised by what was around the corner.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/valley_las_torres_trail-375x500.png\" /></figure><p>  As we closed in on our destination, a dull mist of rain began to fill the air. The path fully broke out of the forest as the flattened treadway turned into a steep rock scramble. With every step closer to the top, the crowds also seemed to increase.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200217_141525-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  There had been a modest amount of people around us all day, but now that Las Torres were just around the corner the group-per-minute ratio seemed to double, then triple, then quadruple. The wind and mist was picking up too, and the clouds were becoming fuller and darker.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200217_143837-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  We made it to the top just as powerful, cold wind gusts forced us to throw on all the extra layers we had in our packs. The weather had held out just long enough for us to reach the base of Las Torres, the epic viewpoint we had been seeking all day. It wasn’t long before the wind and the rain picked up and we began our descent back to the campsite. Within 30 minutes, Las Torres was completely socked-in and we were passing signs setup from the rangers that people were no longer allowed to hike up to the base due to the weather. Good luck indeed!</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200217_150716-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  That evening it rained, and rained, and rained. There was a small, sheltered area with picnic tables for people to cook in, but those who had gotten there first did not seem keen on sharing or showing much urgency in letting others have a turn. We found a spot under a big tree that kept us relatively dry and we chatted with a friendly couple from South Dakota while we ate our unsalted lentils and rice.</p><p>  After dinner it was straight to bed. There isn’t much to do when it’s pouring 45° rain outside and there is no inside to speak of. Once I was cozy in my sleeping bag, I flipped on my headlamp and went to read the book I brought with me as the pitter patter on the tent soothed me closer to sleep. It was then that I realized there was some dampness underneath my sleeping pad. Feeling around with my hand I found that it wasn’t just a little bit of moisture from the rain, but a straight up puddle of water pooling inside of my tent!</p><p>  I quickly threw everything inside my tent back into my backpack. It was now a relentless downpour outside with no sign of slowing. As I moved about I realized that the ground below had become saturated and I was literally camping in a puddle. The tent that had been my home for 5 straight months along the Pacific Crest Trail must have developed some tiny holes - too small for the eye to notice, too small for even water to typically come through, but enough that camping on a literal pool of water was causing my entire sleep space to flood.</p><p>  Frantically, I disassembled my tent. The field we were camping in had filled up with hikers over the day and there were almost no viable spots to safely relocate my leaking shelter. After running around for 15 minutes in the rain, I found a raised wooden platform, not the easiest place to set up a tent that is designed around being staked directly into the ground. Eventually I was able to wrap the guy lines around the wood slats and get my tent back up in working order. The next hour was spent drying the interior of my tent with mine and Dan’s mini camping towels. I slept on edge the whole night, scared I was going to wake up soaking wet in 40° temperatures.</p><h2>Day 2: Campo Italiano</h2><p>  The next morning it was sunny and windy. We had a leisurely start to the day, taking our time to enjoy an oatmeal breakfast as our saturated gear dried. Caracaras, huge birds of prey indigenous to the area, patrolled the campground looking for scraps left by the hikers who had already departed for the day.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200218_110035-500x375.jpg\" /><figcaption>Enjoying breakfast under the same tree we cooked dinner under the night before</figcaption></figure><p>  Our second day of the trek was to be the tamest in terms of the terrain. It was a relatively flat walk that followed a coastal ridgeline overlooking a massive glacier lake on one side and the edge of the mountain range on the other. With Las Torres behind us, the most photographed and well known sight of the park was now in our past. The rest of the trip was set to be a total surprise.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200218_122439-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  We spent a wonderfully pleasant day tromping through open grasslands, over rocky cliffs, and through pine forests. The massive glacier lake always stayed within our sights. Its color was a thick, turquoise blue. Paired with the yellow grass lands, dark green trees, and gray mountains with glistening snow-capped peaks, it was one of the most colorful environments I had ever been in. At one point the trail even took us down to a black sand beach as the turquoise waves crashed into the shore.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200218_131123-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  There were  some periods of rain, but for the most part we were pretty lucky in the weather we were dealt that day. It was later than expected when we finally made it into our campground, hungry and ready to cook dinner. The tent sites were all in a protected forest, something we are glad to discover as the forecasts were calling for more wind and rain overnight.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200218_143749-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  Despite my hope for a dryer night of sleep, it was only an hour or so after retreating into my tent for the night that the downpour started. The water was coming down so fast that the ground below me began to turn into a puddle within minutes. As my tent started to flood, I gave myself a few seconds to quietly curse the powers that be before moving into action mode.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200219_095720-500x375.jpg\" /><figcaption>A dense forest covering the campsite.</figcaption></figure><p>  I once again started packing all of my gear back into my pack. However as I was drying off the interior of the tent, I noticed something was different this time. While the night before I had been camping on a grassy field, the ground of this campsite was 100% mud. With that I started to see small brown spots appearing on the inside of my tent. I quickly realized each spot was one of the small holes that were too small to see but big enough to let the water in.</p><p>  I grabbed my headlamp, repair tape, and swiss army knife as I proceeded to spend the next hour finding the brown spots and taping them shut. By the time I finished, I had patched 24 separate holes and my tent seemed to be staying dry at that point. The rain had also eased up by then, and I was able to head back to sleep confident that dryer nights were ahead of me. </p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200219_095703-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><h2>Day 3: Mirador Francés</h2><p>  After another oatmeal breakfast, we were off to a foggy start on our third day of the trek. We were heading up to what was supposed to be some of the most epic views of the whole trip, but as of 10am we still couldn’t see 100 feet in front of us. We left our tents and extra gear behind as we would be heading back the same way before making our way to our next and final campsite later that day.</p><p>  On the way up we passed a handful of hikers who had camped out near us and had clearly gotten an earlier start as they were already headed back down. To their disappointment, they had remained in the fog the entire morning, not even getting the slightest glimpse of the mountains we sought. We hoped we would be more fortunate.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/view_through_trees-375x500.png\" /><figcaption>Peering at the mountains through the trees and the morning fog.</figcaption></figure><p>  By the time we reached the halfway point, and the first of the two viewpoints, a little bit of luck seemed to come our way. The fog did not lift, but it did break enough that the distant formations of rock and ice became partially visible. As we continued further, the break in the clouds revealed a magnificent rainbow like an ode to good luck that the weather might cooperate for us once again.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200219_102943-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  By the time we reached the top, we had been hit with every kind of weather you can imagine. Sunshine, fog, rain, blistering wind gusts, and even a spout of hail. It was all worth it though, because right as we reached that viewpoint the clouds separated and exposed an incredible mountain range circling all around us.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200219_122645-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  For the full hike back to the campsite the sky remained clear. We routinely had to stop and turn around so that we could take in the sights we missed in the fog on the way up.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200219_133807-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  After we passed through the campground and picked up our tents and extra gear, we were off to our next stop where we would spend the last two nights of our trip. We descended down from the mountains and back into the vibrant grasslands with glacier lakes paralleling the trail once more.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200219_164522-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  That final campground could be seen in the distance by the time we were a mile away. Unfortunately it looked to be the worst site of the whole trip. At the front of it sat a huge lodge where those who did not wish to camp could pay for a bed and enjoy hot meals in a dining room. The rest of us tenting out were left to a wide open field behind the hotel. A barren space broken up only by the occasional bush. The worst of it was the fact that dozens of other campers had already set up their tents, turning the field into a tent city, each one with only 10 feet between them and their neighbor.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200219_171359-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><h2>Day 4: Grey Glacier</h2><p>  Despite the lack of solitude, it was the best night of sleep so far. No rain, no wind, just the quiet sound of the breeze as the stars shined over the vast skyline. Dan put it best, he described the nights at that last campsite like feeling “Patagonia breathing.” </p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200220_072728-500x375.jpg\" /><figcaption>A calm sunset over the campground</figcaption></figure><p>The fourth day of our trek was also to be the last day of hiking. We had one more night of camping out, but day 5 would see us packing our bags to begin the return journey. The huge mountains and vast grasslands of the past three days made way for rolling hills and small canyons as we set off on a trail that continued to surprise us around every turn.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200220_102236-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>The environment was drier than what we encountered in the other areas of the park. Forests were sparser and the hills were covered in chaparral bushes. It was also the first full day of sunshine of our entire trip. Our over-enthusiasm to finally hike in t-shirts and shorts would come back to bite us when the sting of the sunburns would hit us later that afternoon.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200220_111922-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  We paralleled another massive glacier-fed lake most of the day. Unlike the turquoise blue lake we followed on previous days, this one was colored a deep gray. Our destination was the massive glacier feeding this lake, which was named, you guessed it, Grey Glacier.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200220_132340-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  It wasn’t until we arrived at the viewpoint that we truly understood how huge this glacier was. The ice fields stretched from mountain to mountain and reached out into the horizon as far as the eye could see. Icebergs floated by as we relaxed in the sun, taking in all of the beauty.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200220_133018-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><h2>  Going Home</h2><p>  That night we celebrated the successful completion of our W Traverse. While the hotel looming over our campsite wasn’t the most sightly, it did offer the benefit of beer for sale.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200220_214448-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  As the sun set, the crystal clear sky showed the stars with prominence and even the milky way was visible in all its glory. We gazed at the night while we reminisced about the trip before heading off to our last night in the Patagonian wilderness.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200220_220041-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  The next morning we took a catamaran over one of the glacier lakes back to where the bus could pick us up. Even the travel was a part of the journey, as we sped by the mountains we had just become so familiar with.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200221_095415-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  Between naps on the bus ride back to town we saw herds of guanacos, flocks of rheas, and dozens of flamingos. That night we grabbed some drinks at a bar overlooking the sunset behind the mountains and the ocean of southern Chile.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200221_133459-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  The trip back to the states was relatively smooth. We had the same issue in our New York to Boston transfer as we did on the way down - the tickets sold to us were completely different than what was actually operating. They quickly put us on the next flight and we were back home, already yearning for the next adventure.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200221_211823-500x375.jpg\" /></figure>"

This was my first-time summer hiking in the state. Plenty of mountain biking and skiing trips, but I have always stuck to NH, my home state, for hiking. With covid-19 sending a lot of restless Mass residents up to NH for weekend trips, we thought we would avoid the crowds and experience some of the beautiful Long Trail.</p><p>  We started hiking up Mt. Pico Saturday evening. It was a beautiful 4.5 miles of gradual incline at the most beautiful time of day.</p><figure><a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/mountain/5d8d8ad3ac1095001788bbc8\"><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/e2biwhg2i0h51-500x195.png\" /></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/mountain/5d8d8ad3ac1095001788bbc8\">View map of Pico Peak</a></figcaption></figure><p>  The fading sunlight hit the spacious forest undergrowth perfectly.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ahecmjk7j0h51-500x375.png\" /></figure><p>  Passing only the occasional day hiker heading to the car, we were able to have the peak all to ourselves for dinner.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nk4k8nbvh0h51-500x281.png\" /></figure><p>  Waking up to a beautiful sunrise, we were able to get an early start to Killington after some coffee and oatmeal.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tzjdudxqh0h51-500x281.png\" /></figure><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lkw4vcosh0h51-500x281.png\" /></figure><p>  Continuing southbound on the Long Trail we were able to get to Killington Peak with ease. Most of the elevation was done the day prior on our way up Mt Pico.</p><figure><a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/mountain/5d8cb3675a452f00176cf800\"><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/t5nnpnnph0h51-500x349.png\" /></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/mountain/5d8cb3675a452f00176cf800\">View map of Killington Peak</a></figcaption></figure><p>  Killington had a beautiful view, but we only stayed long enough to get a quick snack in. It was a busier peak and Kyle and I enjoy quiet forests more than crowded summits.</p><p>  Our next objective was summiting Mendon Peak. There is no official route to the top of Mendon from Killington, so we continued south on the Long Trail until we could make a beeline to the summit. Occasionally finding a herd path, we were unsure whether it was the moose or previous hikers who first ventured through.</p><figure><a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/mountain/5d8d8aa9ac1095001788bbc7\"><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/zmxq16zih0h51-500x346.png\" /></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/mountain/5d8d8aa9ac1095001788bbc7\">View map of Mendon Peak</a></figcaption></figure><p>  Once we neared the peak, we stumbled upon a clear path to the top. So far the hike was relatively enjoyable, except for the occasional spider web to the face during our tracking of the moose.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wgkgh1vah0h51-500x375.png\" /></figure><p>  We had gone as far as we planned for the day and began our uncharted trip back to the car. Finding a path heading in the direction we planned to bushwhack, we thought the day was almost over. So much in fact, we decided to stop for a leisurely rest by a beautiful stream we come across.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mendonriver-small-500x281.jpg\" /></figure><p>  All that was left was a short 4.5 mile relatively flat hike out to the car via the Catamount Cross-Country ski trail, or so we thought.. This turned out to be a little more strenuous than anticipated.</p><p>  What looked to be a relatively open and clear path turned out to be a breeding ground for the poisonous Stinging Nettle! After only half a mile in, the open path closed. What began with a light discomfort quickly turned into some of the most unbearable tortures I have experienced. The cuts on our legs from the earlier bushwhack only made the situation worse.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/j9dhf3nug0h51-500x333.jpg\" /></figure><p>  The trail was not as flat as earlier assumed. It was in fact a winding trail up and down the hills surrounding the nearby peaks, possibly surpassing the elevation gain already hiked in the day.</p><p>  Exhausted and tortured by Nettle, we stopped at every water source to clean our tormented legs. It wasn’t until we were only a mile and a half from the car that Kyle had the thought to put on our rain pants for protection. What an idea! Adding to the heat of summer, they were not comfortable, but at least our legs were able to get some relief.</p><p>  A few more hills and plenty more nettle, we finally made it to the car, rinsed off at the river, and headed home. What started out as the perfect hike, quickly turned to discomfort, but it will always be one of our more memorable expeditions.</p><p>  You can check out Kyle’s hiking report and suggested trail routes <a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/mountain/5d8cb3675a452f00176cf800\">on Wilderlist</a>.</p>"

Kyle had the idea to head up to the Wild River Wilderness where he spent several years working as a cook at AMC’s Cold River Camp. It’s an area he calls the “Hidden Gem of the White Mountains”. I had never been so I was more than eager to check out a new area of the White Mountains. </p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2009-Wil-River-North-Bald-Face-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  <a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/mountains/5d8fbf1ae0364e2a604d74d9\">North</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/mountain/5d8fbf46e0364e2a604d74da\">South Baldface</a> were obvious choices to hit for my <a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/lists/5d8d8bc8ac1095001788bbcb\">New Hampshire 100 Highest list</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/mountain/5db9d55a2d4ef1001786a432\">Eagle Crag</a> for my <a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/list/5db9dd9a2d4ef1001786a43f\">52 With a View list</a>. But for Kyle, the biggest attraction – pun intended – was the rarely visited little <a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/mountain/5db2f3c1c6974a2b54eaee5a\">West Baldface</a>, on the <a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/list/5db37a25e52f3b0017dc5577\">New Hampshire 200 Highest</a>. </p><figure><a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/mountain/5db2f3c1c6974a2b54eaee5a\"><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wilderlist-map-west-baldface-500x350.jpg\" /></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/mountain/5db2f3c1c6974a2b54eaee5a\">View map of West Baldface</a></figcaption></figure><p>  We started up <a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/mountain/5d8fbf46e0364e2a604d74da\">South Baldface</a> via the Baldface Circle Trail. The ascent was beautiful and slightly technical, with nice open face rock slabs to scramble up. </p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2009_Wild-River-South-Baldface-Rock-Slab-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  Once on the top of South Baldface, it was a short hop over to North Baldface. The views were clear and spectacular. Our only concern was our low supply of water. With such a dry summer, one of our planned water sources had dried up. With this in mind, we decided to save our hike up West Baldface for day 2 and instead head to our camp destination where we could safely hydrate along the way. </p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2009-Wild-River-South-Bald-Face-500x281.jpg\" /></figure><p>  Taking the overgrown Wild River Trail to the isolated Perkins Notch Tentsite, we had our fingers crossed we would hit some water sources sooner rather than later. The Wild River did not disappoint. We came across a couple of still running tributaries with enough water to quench our thirst. It was only a few miles before we arrived at the campsite, but we were happy regardless.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200912_165513-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  The camp was quiet with only a few other hikers. We felt like one of the cool kids, because everyone there was sporting a Dyneema/Cuben Fiber tent and we fit right in with our ZPacks and Tarptents.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2009_Wild-River_Camp-site-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  Waking up early the following day, we made a quick stop to check out the nearby North Ketchum Pond. No moose sightings, unfortunately they must’ve risen even earlier than us. </p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2009_Wild-River-Bog-1-500x281.jpg\" /></figure><p>  After a short backtrack along the Wild River Trail we cut into the woods and began the bushwhack towards our main goal of the trip- West Baldface. The forest was surprisingly open, most likely from past logging in the area, with plenty of small herd paths leading deeper into the wilderness. </p><p>  It was clear by the droppings and tracks that we were following moose and bear paths. </p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2009-Wild-River-West-Bald-Face-3-500x281.jpg\" /></figure><p>  With lookout spots every so often, we were thrilled to be there. </p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2009-Wild-River-West-Bald-Face-2-500x281.jpg\" /></figure><p>  The peak was so open and spectacular that we decided to kick off the trail runners and relax with a warm cup of coffee. </p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200913_105731-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  After a luxurious break we begrudgingly descended the mountain, wishing we could spend the rest of the day relaxing at the peak. </p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2009-wild-river-west-bald-face-summit-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  The hike down was as enjoyable as the peak, with open birch forest and wildlife everywhere. </p><p>  The valley was filled with large round imprints, some definitely from sleeping bears and maybe more from moose. We came across at least 15-20 of these spots mixed in between thigh high ferns. </p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2009-Wild-Rive-West-Bald-Face-Logging-375x500.jpg\" /></figure><p>  A little nervous we might actually stumble onto a napping black bear, we heard a rustle in a patch of nearby brush. Suddenly 3 grouse loudly took off in a hurry. Laughing off the startle, we were able to watch at least 6 more fly off from what was most likely a nesting area.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1920px-Bonasa-umbellus-001edit1-500x357.jpg\" /><figcaption>Source: A ruffed grouse. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grouse#/media/File:Bonasa-umbellus-001edit1.jpg\">Wikipedia</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\">CC BY-SA 3.0</a></figcaption></figure><p>  Shortly after we came across a hawk drinking from a stream.

Making our way back up to the Baldface ridgeline, we stopped off at <a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/mountain/5db9d55a2d4ef1001786a432\">Eagle Crag</a> for my <a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/lists/5db9dd9a2d4ef1001786a43f\">52 With a View list</a>. We then took the Bicknell Ridge Trail back down to the car, saying our goodbyes to the last views of the Baldfaces as we descended back below the tree line.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2009-Wild-River-Eagle-Crag-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><p>  My only hesitation to recommend this area is so I can leave it for myself!</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2009-Wild-River-Heading-Home-500x375.jpg\" /></figure>"

This was by far the most enjoyable section of the hike.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Western-Ma-Ridge-Line-500x375.jpg\" /></figure><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Peak-500x375.jpg\" /></figure>The peak of <a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/mountain/5f04d221676f544db0f18c0f\">Brace Mountain, NY</a> (2,316ft), exposed similar to <a href=\"https://www.wilderlist.app/mountain/5f04d221676f544db0f18b5e\">Alander Mountain, MA</a>, is simple with just an American flag symbolically hanging on for dear life. Along the way back to the car, we added on .8miles to see the MA, NY, and CT tripoint (where they all meet). <figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tripoint-375x500.jpg\" /></figure><p>While it was not the most difficult hike and the beauty was more subtle, it did offer plenty of New England charm and it is always good to get out into the quietness of the woods.</p><figure><img src=\"http://reconnect.life/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alander-Mountain-MA-2231ft-500x375.jpg\" /></figure>"
