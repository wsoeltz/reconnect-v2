In that regard, an extra half pound for less back pain and hip chaffing is totally worth it.The pack itself is fantastic for organizing gear. There is one main compartment where the bulk of my stuff went, and then a few large outer mesh pockets and a handful of smaller compartments located along the straps and hip belts.

In pants mode they could still be worn on a hot desert day without feeling too sweaty and at the same time provided just enough insulation for the colder mornings I experienced. Being able to switch between pants and shorts without having to carry much extra weight proved to be a blessing.On the pants half there is a zipper that runs the whole height. This allows you to easily put them on and off without taking off your shoes. It also allows you to open them fully and allow air flow while hiking in hot weather.
