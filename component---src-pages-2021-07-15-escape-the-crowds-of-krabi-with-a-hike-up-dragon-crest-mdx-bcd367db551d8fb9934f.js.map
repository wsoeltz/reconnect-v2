It is safe to say our taste in travel tends to be more down-to-earth. When our shuttle pulled into the downtown area of Krabi and we saw literal flashing neon lights wrapped around every single tree with vans blasting electronic music driving up and down the strip, we realized we had not done enough research to truly understand the experience we were entering into.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"krab-dragon-crest-3d-rendering.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">3D rendering of the Dragon Crest (via [Wilderlist](https://www.wilderlist.app/))</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`While we did end up having a great time at the beaches and resorts of Krabi, the main highlight of that leg of our trip was definitely our hike up Ngon Nak Nature Trail to the summit of Dragon Crest. It is an 1800ft mountain that overlooks the valley around southern Thailand and the summit has a spectacular overlook of the region.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"krabi-dragon-crest-outlook-1.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">Viewpoint on the way up the mountain</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`Getting there was easy. If you do not have much experience on hiking trails, it might be worth looking into a guide, however if you have basic navigation skills and can read a map, the trail is very straight forward to follow. We hired a taxi to drive us there and arranged for him to pick us up several hours later when we finished.
