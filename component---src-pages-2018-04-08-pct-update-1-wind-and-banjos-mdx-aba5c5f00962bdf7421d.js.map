The point at which I gave up is after my tent collapsed on me twice due to the intensity of the winds. And it's only 10:30, it's probably going to happen again. There's a saying that thru hikers go by - \"embrace the suck.\" Meaning when the shit hits the fan, you still have to find the positive. In this case since I know I won't be sleeping, I now have all this time to reflect and write about the beginning of my journey. `}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180408_092040-500x378.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">The Southern Terminus of the Pacific Crest Trail.</Figcaption>\n    <h2>{`2659 Miles To Go`}</h2>\n    <p>{`It's day one.

Water is heavy, probably the heaviest thing you're carrying in your pack. If you carry too much it'll slow you down, and if you don't carry enough, well we all know what could happen then. Thankfully there are a handful of apps and websites for hikers to use that give the latest updates on water sources along the trail. Much of a day is centered around where you're gonna stop for water.`}</p>\n    <p>{`As we arrived to our next water source at a nearby campground, we were surprised by some trail magic. A guy named Steve had come down to the campground with food and drinks for PCT hikers. There were granola bars, peanut butter and jelly, Gatorade, beer, and best of all- fresh tangerines right off the vine from a local farm. Steve had been a trail angel for several years now, he started when a buddy of his was hiking the trail and enjoyed bringing him food and hanging with the hikers that he made it a tradition. It was a welcome surprise, so thank you Steve!`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180408_094506-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">It's termed the desert, but it's actually a cismontane chaparral due to all of the green vegetation that is able to grow.</Figcaption>\n    <h2>{`Banjo In the Breeze`}</h2>\n    <p>{`It's day 4 and I'm approaching Mount Laguna, a small town in the desert mountains of Southern California. I stop in the Burnt Rancheria campground while I wait for Dennis. I sit alone at a picnic table under the shade of some trees. Nearby a car camper plays the banjo. I listen to the tunes and the sound of the breeze as the smell of pine wafts through the air. I take a sip of some fresh water as I relax in this oasis in the middle of the desert. `}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180408_095102-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">The pine forests of the Mount Laguna region.</Figcaption>\n    <h2>{`Wind Storm`}</h2>\n    <p>{`It's day 5 and the pine forests of the Mount Laguna area quickly dissipate in favor of the chaparral vegetation that is signature of the region.
