That's not including any small up and downs that we did, that's just the net gain from Idyllwild to Jacinto. Most of the trail was on alternate, non-PCT routes, as sections of the trail in that area were closed due to a forest fire several years ago and Jacinto itself isn't officially on the PCT. So that meant the whole \"incline designed for horses\" was not in existence for this section. Instead it often felt like we were going straight up, similar to the hiking I get back in the White Mountains.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"PSX_20180424_193328-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">The open and gradual desert was replaced with steep lush pine forests.</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`To add to the difficulty, it was very cold.

The hike up lead us through gorgeous pine forests where the smell of pine and the sounds of birds chirping provided a sense of relaxation through the pain. And then came the view from the summit- standing at 10,834 feet, we could look straight down to the desert floor, over 9000 feet below us. It was absolutely breathtaking, and something I highly recommend to anyone who finds themselves in the area.

Soon we were out of the shade filled forests and back into the exposed chaparral.

We descended down into a canyon where we reached a small nature preserve with a river running through it. There were palm trees and green meadows and wading pools.
