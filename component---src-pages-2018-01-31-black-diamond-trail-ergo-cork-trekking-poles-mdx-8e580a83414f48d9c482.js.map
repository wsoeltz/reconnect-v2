Before I had always wondered what I needed them for- I had never had a problem getting up and down mountains without them, how would using them make any difference? But hiking in the snow is a totally different game, and after embracing them they’ve now made it into my all-season gear essentials. Between the uphill advantages and the downhill knee-saving, I would highly recommend adding poles to your kit if you haven’t already. And my trekking pole of choice right now is the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.amazon.com/Trail-Ergo-Cork-Walking-70-140cm/dp/B00GZPYWFS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521140917&sr=8-3&keywords=black+diamond+trail+ergo+cork+trekking+poles&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=fee10b2da2d0d1c5907b1019115699fb\"\n      }}>{`Black Diamond Trail Ergo Cork Trekking Poles`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Performance`}</h2>\n    <p>{`In my experience, Black Diamond typically makes very good products and the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.amazon.com/Trail-Ergo-Cork-Walking-70-140cm/dp/B00GZPYWFS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1521140917&sr=8-3&keywords=black+diamond+trail+ergo+cork+trekking+poles&linkCode=ll1&tag=reconnectlife-20&linkId=fee10b2da2d0d1c5907b1019115699fb\"\n      }}>{`Trail Ergo Cork poles`}</a>{` live up to that.

The continual pressure from hiking will slowly push the poles back down to a shorter length.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This can get annoying when you repeatedly have to stop and readjust the height. In the winter it can be even more frustrating if moisture gets inside and freezes, thus preventing you from being able to readjust the height until it has defrosted.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Thankfully it is a really simple fix for this issue. All you have to do is tighten the screws yourself and the poles should work fine.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Durability`}</h2>\n    <p>{`I have had these poles for 3 years now and I have yet to have any malfunctions. I regularly take them on hikes throughout the White Mountains, and while they have plenty of scratches, functionally they are still at 100%.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I wouldn’t consider these poles “heavy”, but there are certainly lighter ones on the market if that is what you are looking for.

While this may be true, I haven’t noticed the benefits myself. I do always make sure to use the poles in the correct hands, but occasionally I’ll have them backwards by accident and it doesn’t feel noticeably different.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Now the cork handle is something that I absolutely stand by.
