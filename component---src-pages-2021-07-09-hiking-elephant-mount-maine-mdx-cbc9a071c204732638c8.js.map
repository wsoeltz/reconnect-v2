The beginning of the hike is very easy to follow. The old logging road eventually narrows and becomes more overgrown but still remains very clear. Eventually the road will come to an abrupt end and you will reach a large cairn that leads into a narrow path in the woods. This is where things begin to get tricky.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"elephant-mountain-logging-road.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">Following the logging road up</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`While this herd-path is easy to follow at first, it quickly becomes covered in cut down trees. A logging company had come in and slashed down all of the smaller trees to allow more light for the larger trees to grow. This makes for a very difficult slog as you have to constantly be climbing over and balancing on top of pile after pile of thin, chopped up logs. Because of this, the herd path largely disappears for the middle section of the hike. I was briefly able to find it again at one point before losing it to more of the logs but then finally found it and followed it consistently near the top of the mountain.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"elephant-mountain-mossy-stream.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">A mossy stream on Elephant Mountain</Figcaption>\n    <p>{`Despite the difficulty in navigating, the hike was otherwise quite enjoyable. There are some great views of the wild Maine wilderness while on the open logging roads, and if you are lucky there are even some views that you can stumble onto while on your bushwhacking route. The herd path weaves in and out of beautiful mossy forests and green marshes, and I ran into a number of woodpeckers, grouse, and snakes. There were even some ripe wild strawberries to sweeten the hike on the way up.
