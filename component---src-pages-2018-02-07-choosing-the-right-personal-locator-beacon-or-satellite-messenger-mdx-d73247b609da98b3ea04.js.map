A PLB does not guarantee a rescue, as things like harsh weather could impair the beacons signal or prevent a search and rescue team from being able to reach you.When it comes to discussing the different options out there, there are two types of devices to look at and three different networks that they run on.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Personal Locator Beacons and COSPAS/SARSAT`}</h2>\n    <p>{`PLBs run on the COSPAS/SARSAT network, a non-profit network that is basically military run. It is the most comprehensive satellite network of the three and it spans the entire globe. The network began back in 1979 as a joint program between the US, Canada, France, and the USSR (replaced by Russia in 1992).The network runs on satellites as well as ground stations placed throughout the planet. An average of 5 people are rescued everyday through the use of COSPAS/SARSAT. These devices serve one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to call for help. They do not cost a subscription and the batteries typically last for years in standby.For more information on the network, you can access the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://cospas-sarsat.int/\"\n      }}>{`official COSPAS/SARSAT website`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"where-plb-on-pack-compressed-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": \"Wear your Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) in an easy to reach location.\"\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">It is a good idea to keep your PLB or Satellite Messenger in an easy to reach location in case you are too impaired to dig through your pack.</Figcaption>\n    <h2>{`Satellite Messengers and Private Networks`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Satellite Messengers run on private, for-profit networks, either Globalstar or Iridium. While both claim to be global or near global, neither is as comprehensive as COSPAS/SARSAT. These networks also require a yearly subscription to use. If you don’t pay the subscription, no one is going to come when you press the button.Additionally, the frequency at which the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/topics/camping-and-hiking/best-personal-locator-beacon/buying-advice\"\n      }}>{`satellite messengers emit their distress signals`}</a>{` is not as powerful as those of the PLBs. You are more likely to make contact with a satellite on the COSPAS/SARSAT network then you are on Globalstar or Iridium. Also most Satellite Messengers run on disposable or rechargeable batteries, and you will regularly have to make sure your device is properly charged.There are still many reasons why you might choose a Satellite Messenger over (or in addition to) a PLB. Since they are on private networks and you are paying a subscription fee, they generally have a whole host of extra features. At a minimum, these additional features include being able to send preset messages and tracking your position for your friends and family at home to see. The higher end devices allow for two texting communication via satellite, so you can communicate with others even outside of cell range. Some models even include full on GPS capabilities, complete with topographic maps and waypoints.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"blue-sky-compressed-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": \"An open, blue sky\"\n      }}></img></p>\n    <Figcaption mdxType=\"Figcaption\">If you can, make sure you have direct access with the sky when using a PLB or Satellite Messenger.
