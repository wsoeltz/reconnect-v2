This was my first-time summer hiking in the state. Plenty of mountain biking and skiing trips, but I have always stuck to NH, my home state, for hiking. With covid-19 sending a lot of restless Mass residents up to NH for weekend trips, we thought we would avoid the crowds and experience some of the beautiful Long Trail.`}</p>\n    <p>{` We started hiking up Mt.

There is no official route to the top of Mendon from Killington, so we continued south on the Long Trail until we could make a beeline to the summit.

After only half a mile in, the open path closed. What began with a light discomfort quickly turned into some of the most unbearable tortures I have experienced.

It was in fact a winding trail up and down the hills surrounding the nearby peaks, possibly surpassing the elevation gain already hiked in the day.`}</p>\n    <p>{` Exhausted and tortured by Nettle, we stopped at every water source to clean our tormented legs. It wasn’t until we were only a mile and a half from the car that Kyle had the thought to put on our rain pants for protection. What an idea! Adding to the heat of summer, they were not comfortable, but at least our legs were able to get some relief.`}</p>\n    <p>{` A few more hills and plenty more nettle, we finally made it to the car, rinsed off at the river, and headed home. What started out as the perfect hike, quickly turned to discomfort, but it will always be one of our more memorable expeditions.`}</p>\n    <p>{` You can check out Kyle’s hiking report and suggested trail routes `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.wilderlist.app/mountain/5d8cb3675a452f00176cf800\"\n      }}>{`on Wilderlist`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
