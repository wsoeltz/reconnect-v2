The views were clear and spectacular. Our only concern was our low supply of water. With such a dry summer, one of our planned water sources had dried up. With this in mind, we decided to save our hike up West Baldface for day 2 and instead head to our camp destination where we could safely hydrate along the way. `}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"2009-Wild-River-South-Bald-Face-500x281.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <p>{` Taking the overgrown Wild River Trail to the isolated Perkins Notch Tentsite, we had our fingers crossed we would hit some water sources sooner rather than later. The Wild River did not disappoint. We came across a couple of still running tributaries with enough water to quench our thirst. It was only a few miles before we arrived at the campsite, but we were happy regardless.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"20200912_165513-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <p>{` The camp was quiet with only a few other hikers.

The forest was surprisingly open, most likely from past logging in the area, with plenty of small herd paths leading deeper into the wilderness. `}</p>\n    <p>{` It was clear by the droppings and tracks that we were following moose and bear paths. `}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"2009-Wild-River-West-Bald-Face-3-500x281.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <p>{` With lookout spots every so often, we were thrilled to be there. `}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"2009-Wild-River-West-Bald-Face-2-500x281.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <p>{` The peak was so open and spectacular that we decided to kick off the trail runners and relax with a warm cup of coffee. `}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"20200913_105731-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <p>{` After a luxurious break we begrudgingly descended the mountain, wishing we could spend the rest of the day relaxing at the peak. `}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"2009-wild-river-west-bald-face-summit-500x375.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <p>{` The hike down was as enjoyable as the peak, with open birch forest and wildlife everywhere. `}</p>\n    <p>{` The valley was filled with large round imprints, some definitely from sleeping bears and maybe more from moose.
